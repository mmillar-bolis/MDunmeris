## QUINTESSENCE

__NOTE:__ Reddit has permanently suspended my account for posting this project. As such, I will no longer be able to answer questions related to it. I am very sorry.

#### Note: Print Sizes

I have made two different sizes available: a more standard US Trade size that is two-column, and a smaller "Pocket" size, similar to Mass Market Paperback dimensions, which is single column. The two editions are almost identical, except for a few small changes.

In the Pocket version:

* The introduction is rearranged to make the best use of available space
* The Temple Oath in Daedric has been removed due to legibility
* The breviary is rearranged to make the best use of available space
* The map of Tamriel has been removed due to legibility

#### How to Print

Printing something on Lulu is really easy but first you will need to download the interior and cover `.pdf`s.

Next, create an account at [lulu.com][1] and head to your [Projects Page][2] to create a new project.

On the Start page, be sure to set a category (it's a required field, I guess?). For fun, I chose "Religion & Spirituality" but there are other applicable categories as well, such as "Games" and "Fiction".

Below are the steps I used on the Design page to set up my book:

__Product Type:__ Print Book\
__Goal Option:__ Print Your Book\
__Interior File:__ [*us_trade_interior-codex_sinramus.pdf*][3]\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;or [*lulu_pocket_interior-codex_sinramus.pdf*][4]\
__Book Specifications:__\
&emsp;__Size:__ US Trade *or* Pocket Book\
&emsp;__Interior Color:__ Color Standard\
&emsp;__Paper Type:__ #60 White\
&emsp;__Book Binding:__ Hardcover\
&emsp;__Cover Finish:__ Glossy\
__Cover File:__ [*us_trade_hardcover-codex_sinramus.pdf*][5]\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;or [*lulu_pocket-hardcover-codex_sinramus.pdf*][6]

          You may receive two false-positive errors, as seen in the image to the left. One of them has to do with fine details in the images that might not show up on the printer.

#### Making Modifications

The first thing you will want to grab is a copy of Lulu's book design reference guide.

[__Lulu Book Creation Guide__][7]

If you would like to make your own modifications to the Quintessence, my OpenDocument project file, as well as all of the image and font assets can be found in the [project folder on GitHub][8], or at the link on the [Quintessence Release Page][9]. Here's a direct link to the resource bundle in a `.zip`:

[__Source Document and Resource Bundle__][10]

When exporting to `.pdf`, I use the archive format PDF/A-1b to ensure there is no transparency in the raster images.
