<img align="left" alt="M" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_m.svg">emories are fleeting, flawed, and fragile. So easily overwritten by emotion and prejudice.
<b>&sup2;</b>I cannot think of a more unregulated recording of events, which is why I commit my thoughts into the unchanging metal of my sequence plaques.
<b>&sup3;</b>But even the most objective view can still hold bias, and words can only convey so much.
<b>&#8308;</b>The engravings on this plaque pale to the complexity of a simple human thought, with all the nuances and richness that even a common mind can hold.

<b>&#8309;</b>Lord Seht knows this. After all, his heart drives the Wheels Eternal, oiled and calibrated. This we know.
<b>&#8310;</b>To become that which is the only true name, which is not Name, one's mind must be polished. Synchronized. How to accomplish such a task?
<b>&#8311;</b>Even a god may become overburdened with the weight of emotions, fractured from the whole which is logic.

<b>&#8312;</b>But in this too the Clockwork God was wise. He gave his memories form, manifestation.
<b>&#8313;</b>Glowing stars to make up the galaxy of his thoughts. Tangible and real, far more real than ink upon parchment, than words or whispers.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>Whole and perfect, and only able to be so from the strength of his divinity, his gleaming and peerless mind which holds the true order of all.

<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>Memories are flawed, yes, but they are precious all the same. They hold our wisdom and knowledge, all that which we are.
<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>To give them away would be squandering that gift, and this too Lord Seht knew.
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>So he preserved these precious thoughts, locked safely with his Mnemonic Planisphere. Watched over by the ever-silent Astronomer.
<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>A multitude of stars which no longer held emotional sway over him, no, but still remained connected, known.

<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>It's quiet in the Planisphere, but one hears whispers. A low hum of voices seem to echo within the halls.
<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>Those figures of the past, lost but not forgotten, come to light once more.
