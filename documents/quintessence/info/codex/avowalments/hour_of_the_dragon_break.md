<img align="left" alt="S" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_t.svg">he middle dawn is an axis for the spirits of the Foretime.
<b>&sup2;</b>As such, many of the beliefs of the primitive Psijics cannot be discounted; here, in this place, are proofs within proofs.
<b>&sup3;</b>Of special note is the Blue Star, which the Alesstics call "Mnemoli", that runs through this part of the Aurbis every untime.

<b>&#8308;</b>The Psijics hold it in much reverence, and many of their folk make pilgrimages to Veloth when it appears because a mountain there catches fire at its passing.
<b>&#8309;</b>This mountain is reputed to be one of the last refuges of the Dwemer before they departed from this world.

<b>&#8310;</b>And so to most, the middle dawn is little more than an undisputable and grandiose display of mystic power, which is to say nonsense, and few regard it as the numinous gateway that it really signifies.
<b>&#8311;</b>Like many things they cannot explain, the middle dawn is merely another excuse to declare good omens and portents, but unto you it should be known as the Hurling Disk, numbered seventeen.

<b>&#8312;</b>According to the texts,
Mnemoli is a wayward child of
<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">ANU</span>,
one of a pantheon of forgotten deities known as the "Star Orphans", a tribe of gods and goddesses that apparently felt abandoned when the Sun withdrew from the World-Making.
<b>&#8313;</b>Like many of her siblings, Mnemoli is both confused and delighted with the Aurbis,
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>and explores its five quarters as best she can without the help and regulation of worship, which are not needed (by which I mean, always there) during breakings of the sideways wheel.

<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>The Hurling Disk, it is conjectured, contains a strange mingling of magic from both the Solar and Lunar spheres.
<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>That singular rarity, coupled with the rarity of its presence within the world, has kept it from gaining a strong foothold in the schools of known sorcery.
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>The Selectives claim a similar source of power in their depictions of the Right Reaching, but that has not deterred those magicians which still try to fathom the meaning of the middle dawn and what benefits they may derive from that understanding.
<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>Perhaps it is the association of Mnemoli with the vanishing of sequential sensation (and, by extension, the teeth-filled stare of the Alinor Dragon that comes thereafter) that drives seekers of arcane knowledge to pledge their scholarship to the Aetherius
<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>rather than dealing with the esoteric teachings of my murder-brother
<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">SEHT</span>
or her many aspects, who loves the secret tower so much that she trucks with folk that first gave it legs, head, and sexual recepticle.

<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>One last note regarding the phenomenon of the middle dawn: it should be mentioned that at least one myth ("the Blue Bone-Ring of Jyg") suggests a relationship between Mnemolic sorcery and the Void Ghost Eaters, the magic practiced in the countless Trickster cults scattered throughout the Tamri-El.
