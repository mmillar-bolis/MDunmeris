<img align="left" alt="H" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_h.svg">e has come down from the mountains, the chitin of his belly segments freshly painted in Faith.
<b>&sup2;</b>The suns shine overhead, each uttering his name in their way.

<b>&sup3;</b>The barrens before him distort in the blur of their heat as he climbs the last hill, but his vision is clear. It always has been.
<b>&#8308;</b>His fifth and second arms encircle his staff as his mandibles click out a small prayer.
<b>&#8309;</b>Beyond the barrens lay the Crescent of the Eighty and One Thrones, and all the villages that hang from it like a jeweled belt.

<b>&#8310;</b>They do not know it yet, those millions that work, rule, and commit their countless sins out there in the cradle of all written history, but he will save them.
<b>&#8311;</b>In ones and twos, then in droves, and then their own priests and their own kings will throw down their false idols and take up the New Faith.

<b>&#8312;</b>He would permit himself some pride if that emotion occurred to him;
<b>&#8313;</b>instead, he tests his locust wings on the wind, permitting himself to glide into the first steps of Salvation.
