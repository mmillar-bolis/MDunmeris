<img align="left" alt="W" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_w.svg">hen the Tribunal mortals reached into the center, they ceased to be anything except for what they wished to be.
<b>&sup2;</b>The axis erupted. There was an exact cracking, an instant of pure Aurbis, their hands burnt black by that ever-nil of static change, and the gods who had never been had always been.
<b>&sup3;</b>A whole universe swelled up to legitimize their throne, as the old universe, where the mortals still lapped up Godsblood, warped itself to accept its new equivalent.
<b>&#8308;</b>And like all things magical it simply could not happen, could not Be. Red Mountain was the intersection of the Is-Is Not as it was of old, its center point, and it did not hold.
<b>&#8309;</b>And so the Dragon, having broken, saw fit to heal, turning into the world you know. Except now the gods were alive before their own birth, which had, in fact, really happened in the death of the last universe.

The Tribunal gloriously usurped the worship of their Anticipations, as was foretold in the words of Veloth.

<b>&#8311;</b>Earlier than Vehk were Ayem and Seht. They had supplanted in the orbit of the Chimeri soul those Daedra that predated them, Mephala and Boethiah and Azura respectively.
<b>&#8312;</b>None of them did this out of criminal intent. Rather, these beings were the Anticipations in the truest sense, the fore-images of the gods that would come for Morrowind.
<b>&#8313;</b>The gods hold the original Triune in honor as the bringers of difference and culture, and knowledge, and revere them as the harbingers of the glory of
<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">ASV</span>.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>And never did we question their divinities or remove them from our holy books.

But as Vehk once spoke of the Rainmaker, the needs of the people change, and those that provide guidance to them must also change.
<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>While it may seem strange to imply that the fore-images of the Tribunal, being Daedra, were adverse to change, they were, and they are.
<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>In this they are very alike to the Aedra in their fundaments.
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>While born of Padomay, they are of too much ego to give up their realms entirely, especially for altruism, which is perhaps what they most hate.

<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>And so from their basis did the Tribunal spring, called to heaven by violence, our people throwing our mantles to them across stars, and across time, and magic and dream, and here they remain.
