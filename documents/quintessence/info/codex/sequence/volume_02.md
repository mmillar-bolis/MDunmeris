<b>&sup1;</b>By the word, I wind the gears.

<img align="left" alt="T" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/sequence/letter_t.svg">he will of Sotha Sil is the chrononymic will. The Nameless Will. For what is "Name?"
<b>&sup3;</b>The Divine Metronome tells us that "Name" is the wedge that pries gear from pinion.
<b>&#8308;</b>The residue of Lorkhan's Great Lie that loosens the wheel chain and corrodes the frame.
<b>&#8309;</b>The et'Ada Gears named each and each, in their way.
<b>&#8310;</b>Our lessers see this as a kindness, but the Mainspring Ever-Wound calls it a curse, rooted in selfish pride.
<b>&#8311;</b>To name is to cleave one from another.
<b>&#8312;</b>It is the death of Anuic convergence and the Nirn-Ensuing&mdash;the misassembled dragon that breathes dry falsehood and whose name is "Multitude."

<b>&#8313;</b>There is only one name that is not Name. Seht, the convergent Clockwork God, whose will pumps like a piston into both "then" and "after."
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>Sotha Sil, Father of Mystery, whose heart drives the Wheels Eternal and whose blood oils the All-Axle.
<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b><span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">SI</span>,
the Divine Engine, whose mind merges "they" and "we" and births the Nirn-Ensuing.
<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>Lesser wills are wisps of smoke, born and lost in a sea of endless sky. Lost children whose freedom is death.

<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>For what is freedom, child of the Tribunal? The counter-lever to slavery? No.
<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>Have you not heard the words in sequence? The chrononymic will is the pendulum that swings only once.
<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>It cannot do otherwise. To swing twice would break one intention from another and prove the blasphemy of two.
<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>As Padomay is illusion, so too is the named will.
<b>&sup1;&#8311;</b>For what is "choice" if not chaos? What is "free will" if not the lack of order, vulgar and triumphant?
<b>&sup1;&#8312;</b>The true wheels spin clockwise, ever clockwise. In the unity of Nirn-Ensuing, each belongs to all, and all belong to none&mdash;save Tamriel Final. Anuvanna'si.
<b>&sup1;&#8313;</b>So lay down your cheap burdens, child. "Shall I do thus?" Such "choice" is delusion.
<b>&sup2;&#8304;</b>Give yourself to the pursuit of unity, for in the end, you cannot do otherwise.

<b>&sup2;&sup1;</b>By the word, I wind the gears.
