reverence for The Old, child of Seht. The oil of antiquity often fuels the future.
<b>&sup3;</b>Those who ignore the counsel of our blessed ancestors do so at their peril.
<b>&#8308;</b>But not all ruins hide wisdom within their shattered halls. Some ruins are dark and barren places&mdash;
<b>&#8309;</b>unsteady graves for lies and curses. Resting places for bent axles, stripped bolts, and the bitter silence of inertia.

<b>&#8310;</b>In the time before our Father's rise, old and feeble knowledge ruled the hearts of mer.
<b>&#8311;</b>The children of ash entered their ancestral tombs not in search of truth, but in search of truth's corpse.
<b>&#8312;</b>They saw their forebears not as proud and vigorous guides, but as wheezing, toothless ghosts&mdash;
<b>&#8313;</b>guardians of the musty and derelict engines that fools call deep wisdom. You must smash these old machines, child of Seht!
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>The past does not rust upon the scrap pile. It hurtles toward the Mainspring Ever-Wound's glorious and multi-angled future, whipped by the scorching tongues of our honored forebears!
<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>Ever do their words and deeds grease the wheels of the Nirn-Ensuing!
<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>Ever do they weld the seams of Tamriel Final! Anuvanna'si.

<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>But alas! Even now, stewards of The Old feed aged truth to those who would listen.
<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>They are the daughters and sons of
<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">PSJJJJ</span>
who crouch like gargoyles over musty tomes, faces hidden beneath frayed and graying robes.
<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>They counsel caution, temperance, and equanimity&mdash;ancient virtues of the fading Nirn-Prior.
<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>Even so, the Father of Curiosity calls them friends.
<b>&sup1;&#8311;</b>With a god's patience, He teaches them. With a father's love, He guides them; all in the hopes that one day they may see the deepest truth of The Old:
<b>&sup1;&#8312;</b>that we must banish our feeble ghosts and give their memory new life through the thrice-folded mind.
<b>&sup1;&#8313;</b>Toothless gears cannot be repaired&mdash;they must be melted and reforged. So it is with our people's truth.

<b>&sup2;&#8304;</b>None will deny that the daughters and sons of
<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">PSJJJJ</span>
wield great power.
<b>&sup2;&sup1;</b>Like our Clockwork City, their isle of Artaeum glides between what is and what may be.
<b>&sup2;&sup2;</b>Like our Clockwork Apostles, they study, strive, and create. But power without an infinite future's courage is like an empty boiler&mdash;
<b>&sup2;&sup3;</b>infused with fierce heat but producing no steam. Woe upon those who recoil from Tamriel Final! Anuvanna'si.
<b>&sup2;&#8308;</b>The will of the Clockwork God turns such cowardice to slag.
<b>&sup2;&#8309;</b>But rejoice! The Father of Mysteries' affection proves the worth of
<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">PSJJJJ</span>.
<b>&sup2;&#8310;</b>One day these lost spellweavers will heed the words of the Divine Metronome and seek the true and noble change&mdash;the aratagnithir.
<b>&sup2;&#8311;</b>On that day we shall embrace them not as friends, but as brothers and sisters.

<b>&sup2;&#8312;</b>By the word, I wind the gears.
