<b>&sup1;</b>By the word, I wind the gears.

<img align="left" alt="B" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/sequence/letter_b.svg">lessed Father of Mystery, place your oil upon my tongue that I might tell the true tale of Mournhold.
<b>&sup3;</b>Behold the strength of untold calculation! Behold the power of the Mainspring Ever-Wound!

<b>&#8308;</b>Every Nameless soul must confess the truth of Mournhold, for many lessons hide in its ashes.
<b>&#8309;</b>Sing now the hymn of anguish and horror, child of Seht!
<b>&#8310;</b>Behold, Mehrunes Dagon, Sovereign of Destruction! Mehrunes Dagon, the Flame Tyrant! Mehrunes Dagon, Father of Cataclysm!
<b>&#8311;</b>Recall how he marched upon Almalexia's jewel! Do you remember how his Will burned like kiln-fire, and hot pitch fell from his lips?
<b>&#8312;</b>Aloft, he held four great razors. Each sang a screeching paean to glorify him.
<b>&#8313;</b>Torrents of flame fell upon the innocent and wicked alike, shearing flesh from bone; belching forth widows and orphans in gouts of frothing screams.

<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>"Who dares to face me, draped as I am in fire and blood?" roared Dagon.
<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>The dark Prince beat his breast and howled long-forgotten curses. The dead burst forth from their tombs, shrieking for mercy.
<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>The dark Prince beat his breast and howled long-forgotten curses. The dead burst forth from their tombs, shrieking for mercy.
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>And everywhere, flames&mdash;an inferno that turned all souls to ash.

<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>Almalexia, Mother of Mercy, cast her eyes upon the ruins of her gemmed city and wept.
<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>To see such love burned and squandered turned her heart to molten brass.
<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>Our Clockwork God took note of her fury, sealing the memory away in his great mnemonic planisphere&mdash;a reminder of her love's high price.

<b>&sup1;&#8311;</b>Rising from the ground like foundry-smoke, the Tribunes confronted the Prince of Disasters.
<b>&sup1;&#8312;</b>Ayem's voice like a screeching steam-whistle, and Sotha Sil's like a lurching engine.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup1;&#8313;</b>"<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric"><span style="color:red">ERAM VAR AE ALTADOON</span>!</Span>"</span>

they cried, rending their garments and donning their killing masks.
<b>&sup2;&#8304;</b>Ayem drew her bright Hopesfire and skipped over the flames like a river-stone.
<b>&sup2;&sup1;</b>With a mighty scream, she plunged the blade deep into Dagon's breast and turned it like a jailer's key.
<b>&sup2;&sup2;</b>Scorching blood spewed out of the wound, scalding her hands and face.
<b>&sup2;&sup3;</b>As she fell, the Divine Metronome chiseled a thought-rune of infinite angles.
<b>&sup2;&#8308;</b>Do you remember how the veins of tin, copper, and orichalc erupted from the depths to break our mother's Fall?
<b>&sup2;&#8309;</b>Through His will alone, Mighty Seht wound the veins into god-bronze whips, and lashed the Prince pitilessly.
<b>&sup2;&#8310;</b>Dagon hissed and tumbled backward. His otherworldly flesh fell like chaff before the scythe.
<b>&sup2;&#8311;</b>Alas, a Sarmissonays'um ghoul-thing emerged from every chunk.

<b>&sup2;&#8312;</b>A multitude of the creatures gathered around Ayem, fiery tar oozing from their mouths and open sores.
<b>&sup2;&#8313;</b>They groaned and retched, speaking only Dagon's name as they fell upon her.
<b>&sup3;&#8304;</b>The Warden hissed thrice, took up her blessed sword, and smote the beasts by the score.
<b>&sup3;&sup1;</b>She severed head from neck and arm from shoulder, cleaving sin from virtue and shouting old-oaths of banishing.
<b>&sup3;&sup2;</b>Do you remember how the beasts fell to her on that red day?
<b>&sup3;&sup3;</b>You must recall the howls of Madness! How Dagon foamed and snarled beneath the lash of Sotha Sil!
<b>&sup3;&#8308;</b>"Behold!" cried the Divine Metronome as He smashed the Prince to splinters.
<b>&sup3;&#8309;</b>"Behold the wrath of lost Ald Sotha! Know death at my hands, false-son of a false-father!

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup3;&#8310;</b><span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric"><span style="color:red">KAER PADHOME VIE ALTADOON</span>!</span>"</span>

<b>&sup3;&#8311;</b>Even then, at the end, the Prince of Destruction did not relent.
<b>&sup3;&#8312;</b>With the last of his four great arms, Dagon dragged the last of his four great razors across the Watchmaker's jaw.
<b>&sup3;&#8313;</b>Tasting the blood on His tongue, our Father of Mysteries whispered a final chrononymic death-word, and Dagon exploded throughout all time.
<b>&#8308;&#8304;</b>The earthbones quaked and the All-Axle shook. From this word of sundering, Truth took root.

<b>&#8308;&sup1;</b>Mehrunes's ruin slithered between the cracks of Nirn and Oblivion, shrieking curses like a petulant child. The Mainspring Ever-Wound tightened His brass-wrought fist and slammed the gap shut&mdash;
<b>&#8308;&sup2;</b>another small step toward Tamriel Final. Anuvanna'si.
<b>&#8308;&sup3;</b>So ends the true account of Mournhold's fall. Remember this tale always.

<b>&#8308;&#8308;</b>By the word, I wind the gears.
