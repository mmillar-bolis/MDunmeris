<b>&sup1;</b>By the word, I wind the gears.

<img align="left" alt="T" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/sequence/letter_t.svg">he Mainspring Ever-Wound values craft above all things.
<b>&sup3;</b>She who shapes and assembles, he who conceives and creates&mdash;these are the true children of the Clockwork God.

<b>&#8308;</b>Your labors need not whirr and hiss like the sublime clockworks of Sotha Sil.
<b>&#8309;</b>The brush, the auger, the tongs, the needle&mdash;each and each may honor the Father of Mysteries, so long as they speak His truth.
<b>&#8310;</b>And what is His truth, child of Seht? Perfection only? No.
<b>&#8311;</b>Hear the words in sequence! Simple precision is naught but the shadow of virtue.
<b>&#8312;</b>Even a faithless smith may fashion the blade with the keenest edge.
<b>&#8313;</b>The perfect sphere, the clearest glass, the truest angle&mdash;all fall short of His favor.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>Only through the purest incongruities and greatest doubts do we earn His blessing.
<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>You must think with the thrice-folded mind. You must gaze upon the unsequence.

<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>No mortal may grasp the unsequence fully. We see the edges only&mdash;the liminal truths.
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>For some, the unsequence brings despair. Others look upon it with a child's bewilderment.
<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>But for the precious few, the Nameless explorers, this thin ray of understanding may serve as the Bridge of Infinite Curve. The Walking Wheel.

<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>Know this, ash-child: only the intrepid mind may walk this path.
<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>For you see, the Nameless soul is the tightrope walker that strides in circles only.
<b>&sup1;&#8311;</b>Below and aside, waits the gaping maw of Sheogorath's lie. Ahead and above, waits Tamriel Final. Anuvanna'si.

<b>&sup1;&#8312;</b>I hear your cries, child of Seht! "How does one walk the wheel?" you ask.
<b>&sup1;&#8313;</b>Here lies a Nameless truth. Just as no wrench fits all bolts, no walk fits all souls.
<b>&sup2;&#8304;</b>For the sculptor, it may mean an angle inverted, or a form transposed&mdash;an abandonment of the Named resemblance and an embrace of the abstract.
<b>&sup2;&sup1;</b>For the scholar of maths, it could require half-mad theorems&mdash;rooms of cubic numbers and functions only imagined.
<b>&sup2;&sup2;</b>For the inventor, it may demand a tool without any known use, or an answer-machine that prints only questions.

<b>&sup2;&sup3;</b>Craft perfected, and use obscure: this is the surest path to Tamriel Final. Anuvanna'si.

<b>&sup2;&#8308;</b>By the word, I wind the gears.
