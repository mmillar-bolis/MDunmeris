<b>&sup1;</b>By the word, I wind the gears.

<img align="left" alt="T" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/sequence/letter_t.svg">hink now on the wheel. To all things it appertains.

<b>&sup3;</b>Is there anything so sacred as the wheel? Like Tamriel Final, the wheel both moves and does not move. Anuvanna'si.
<b>&#8308;</b>The axle sleeps, while the spokes make haste&mdash;round and round in reflective circles.
<b>&#8309;</b>Now, here dwells a Nameless secret, child of the Tribunal: does a thing move when it moves in circles?

<b>&#8310;</b>Motion lies at the heart of the Nirn-Ensuing, but not all motion is Nameless. Not all movement earns His blessing.

<b>&#8311;</b>The Divine Metronome calls the first motion "The Motion of Lines."
<b>&#8312;</b>Line-motion is the motion of simple minds&mdash;the motion of weak wills and scholars' vanity.
<b>&#8313;</b>"Forward!" it cries! Forward to the fruits of cheap ambition. Forward to the promise of everlasting kingdoms. Forward to the mirage that the sages call "progress."
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>These misguided pioneers venture out into their wild tomorrows, and the tomorrows after that, certain of their worth&mdash;their virtue.
<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>But what profits a man or mer to gaze deep into a single future?
<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>The aims of mortals are narrow, far too narrow!
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>To move forward is to ignore infinite angles in favor of one. It is the act of a beast or a child.
<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>The Clockwork God spurns vanity in the guise of courage. These explorers' travels only lead them farther from Tamriel Final. Anuvanna'si.

<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>Seht speaks of the second motion only in whispers. "The Pendulum" or "Named Oscillation" is the tic-tock motion&mdash;the motion of entropy and false hope.
<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>None but the Clockwork God may claim its dark power. With each wide swing it shouts Lorkhan's lie.
<b>&sup1;&#8311;</b>"Hail, intentions divided! Hail, cursed multitudes!"
<b>&sup1;&#8312;</b>Do not stand in the Pendulum's path, ash-child. Only the Mainspring Ever-Wound may bear its weight.

<b>&sup1;&#8313;</b>Do not stand in the Pendulum's path, ash-child. Only the Mainspring Ever-Wound may bear its weight.
<b>&sup2;&#8304;</b>Like the Father of Mystery, it gives and takes in equal measure.
<b>&sup2;&sup1;</b>As the bow upon the strings, it calls forth the sublime. As the carpenter's saw, it wrenches back and forth, sundering the Named pursuits of lesser mer.
<b>&sup2;&sup2;</b>Only a Nameless heart may harness its strength.
<b>&sup2;&sup3;</b>The artist, the star-counter, and the engineer call it "muse." The truth-blind multitudes call it "destroyer."

<b>&sup2;&#8308;</b>Do you see now, child of the Tribunal? Every movement hides intent. To stray from the wheel is to abandon the Clockwork God.
<b>&sup2;&#8309;</b>In the Tamriel Final, all shall spin, and only spin. Anuvanna'si.

<b>&sup2;&#8310;</b>By the word, I wind the gears.
