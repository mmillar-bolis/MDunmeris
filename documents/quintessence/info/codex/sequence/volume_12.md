<b>&sup1;</b>By the word, I wind the gears.

<img align="left" alt="I" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/sequence/letter_i.svg"> have spoken the words in sequence, child of Seht. I have guided your eyes to the glorious Nirn-Ensuing&mdash;
<b>&sup3;</b>to the inevitable grandeur of Tamriel Final. Anuvanna'si.
<b>&#8308;</b>I have shouted my grave admonitions and whispered the secrets of the infinite curve. Now, as my engine fails, I bestow upon you my final blessing.
<b>&#8309;</b>You who sing the song of making and set your wheels to axles&mdash;you intrepid star-counters who shatter the old machines and smelt new truths from the crude and forgotten ores of the Aurbis&mdash;you must hear this ultimate lesson.

<b>&#8310;</b>Tamriel Final shall change you in ways both grand and terrifying. Anuvanna'si.
<b>&#8311;</b>Just as molten brass cools in its mold, so too will your body take on a new and hardened shape.
<b>&#8312;</b>Just as water changes from liquid to steam, so too will the cheap preoccupations of your mind disperse and fade.
<b>&#8313;</b>Just as oil ignites and powers the engine, so too will your soul glow bright and drive the Wheels Eternal.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>The unity of Tamriel Final must wash away our selfish pursuits and jealous will, ash-child. Anuvanna'si.
<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>In the glorious Nirn-Ensuing, we must exorcise that grinning apparition we call "I." Only then can we know the sublime truth of the Mainspring Ever-Wound.
<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>We must walk change's road if we seek the end of disorder&mdash;and like all roads worth walking, it fills our hearts with joy and terror.

<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>How like the et'Ada gears we are&mdash;content to live our lives in vain and sequestered sorrow, all the while oblivious to the anguished cries of our fractured souls!
<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>Look upon the lonely shore of Nirn. What do you see, with your broken eyes?
<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>One beach? One sea? Deceit and vanity! The Named illusion!
<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>For what is a "beach" if not a desperate agglomeration of isolated grains?
<b>&sup1;&#8311;</b>What is a "sea" if not a churning mass of solitary tears? Separate! Broken! Arrogant and futile!

<b>&sup1;&#8312;</b>Even after meditating upon these sermons, there are some among you who cling to the Nirn-Prior.
<b>&sup1;&#8313;</b>You fear the loss of your thin and impoverished "self." You must cast aside these childish fears!
<b>&sup2;&#8304;</b>What good is a "self" if it burns away at the threshold of what waits beyond time?
<b>&sup2;&sup1;</b>Do you not see that the Father of Mysteries seeks to usher our world through the End? To protect us from the lies-made-flesh who seek to destroy us?
<b>&sup2;&sup2;</b>If you remember only one thing, let it be this: our blessed Clockwork God loves you with a fierce and awesome heart.
<b>&sup2;&sup3;</b>What he does, he does for you and for all who would follow his divine example.

<b>&sup2;&#8308;</b>Lasting joy. The peace of unity. The sublime satisfaction of perfect rhythm; these are the product of our honest labors&mdash;the spokes of our blessed wheel that spins eternal.
<b>&sup2;&#8309;</b>The Mainspring Ever-Wound offers perfection, child of Seht. You have but to gaze within.
<b>&sup2;&#8310;</b>Stoke your coals. Add fresh water to your boilers. Tighten your bolts, and believe. Tamriel Final awaits. Anuvanna'si.

<b>&sup2;&#8311;</b>By the word, I wind the gears.
