<b>&sup1;</b>By the word, I wind the gears.

<img align="left" alt="B" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/sequence/letter_b.svg">ehold, the Clockwork City! The Throne Aligned! The Omni-Axle!
<b>&sup3;</b>The Brass-Throat Herald of Joyful Destruction! The Oil-Slick Tower of Seamless Assembly! Rejoice! Rejoice!

<b>&#8308;</b>Listen, child of the Tribunal! Do you not hear the whirr of the gears? The hiss of the pistons?
<b>&#8309;</b>It is the voice of Sotha Sil, calling you to the Nirn-Ensuing. To the Tamriel Final. Anuvanna'si.
<b>&#8310;</b>Cast down your worldly maths. Loosen the chains of your selfish pursuits.
<b>&#8311;</b>Shall I describe it to you? Shall I guide your eyes to the future of Nirn?
<b>&#8312;</b>Hear the words in sequence, dark child. Close your eyes and awaken!

<b>&#8313;</b>Gaze up to behold a crystal sky, girded and bound by Seht's bright bands.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>Look down to behold the black stone of His will, and His imagination made clay.
<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>Drink His truth, thick as blood, from the broad black rivers.
<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>Feel His breath on your skin&mdash;let its dreamy redolence fill your nostrils and sting your eyes.
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>You stand at the center of the wheel. The home of the Mainspring Ever-Wound.

<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>Obsidian towers stretch ever skyward, festooned with polished brass and godly filigrees.
<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>Great turbines drive memory through a thousand thousand pipes that stretch out like tangled veins, or the golden roots of an ageless tree.
<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>And wandering amidst the humming and hissing paradise are His second-children. The Fabri'siraynosim. The merged-ones.
<b>&sup1;&#8311;</b>Birthed of the unsequence, and bound to the Nirn-Ensuing. They cry out in one voice: "Death to Multitudes! Woe and terror!
<b>&sup1;&#8312;</b>Let the fragments melt in the Boiler of Unknown Angles! Let the falsehoods burn in the Furnace of Forgotten Numbers!
<b>&sup1;&#8313;</b>Disassemble and cleanse! Dismantle and make whole!"
<b>&sup2;&#8304;</b>They are the guardians&mdash;the ever-wound key-lords.
<b>&sup2;&sup1;</b>Only the Nameless heart avoids their wrath. Their hatred of discord knows no limits.
<b>&sup2;&sup2;</b>For the road to Tamriel Final is not a bloodless one, child of the Tribunal. Anuvanna'si.
<b>&sup2;&sup3;</b>Contemplate this with a pious heart. Seek a clean and well-oiled soul. It shall serve you well in His truth-to-come.

<b>&sup2;&#8308;</b>So you see the Clockwork City is like Sotha Sil Himself&mdash;rich in beauty for the faithful, and alight with sublime terror for the servants of chaos.
<b>&sup2;&#8309;</b>In which Clockwork City would you reside? Commit your small blasphemies and think on this.

<b>&sup2;&#8310;</b>By the word, I wind the gears.
