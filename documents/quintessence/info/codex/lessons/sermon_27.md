#### <span style="color:red">Sermon Twenty-Seven</span>

<img align="left" alt="T" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/vivec/initial_27.svg">he Scripture of the Word,

First:

'All language is based on meat. Do not let the sophists fool you.'\
&#8203;

<b>&sup2;</b>Second:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The third walking path explores hysteria without fear. The efforts of madmen are a society of itself, but only if they are written.
<b>&sup3;</b>The wise may substitute one law for another, even into incoherence, and still say he is working within a method. This is true of speech and extends to all scripture.'</span>

<b>&#8308;</b>Third:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'Do not go to the realm of apology for absolution. Beyond articulation, there is no fault.
<b>&#8309;</b>The Adjacent Place, where the Grabbers live, is the illusion of the vocal or the middle realms of thought, by which I mean the constructed.
<b>&#8310;</b>This is how I stole the certainty of the Chancellor of Exactitude, perfect to look upon from every angle.
<b>&#8311;</b>When you come out of the vocal, you can never be certain.'</span>

<b>&#8312;</b>Fourth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The truest body of work is made up of silence: as in the silence that results from no reference. By the word I mean the dead.'</span>

<b>&#8313;</b>Fifth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The first meaning is always hidden.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>Sixth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The realm of apology is perfection and impossible to attack. Thus, the wise avoid it.
<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>Trinity in unity is the world and word of action: the third walking path.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>Seventh:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The sage who suppresses his best aphorism: cut off his hands, for he is a thief.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>Eighth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The clothes of the broken map are worn only by fools and heretics. The map is an exit for laziness.
<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>It is the dusty tongue, which is to say the given chart that most take as a story that is complete. No word is true until it is eaten.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>The ending of the words is
<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">ASV</span>.
