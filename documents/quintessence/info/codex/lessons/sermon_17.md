With this, Vivec became greater than he had been.
<b>&sup2;</b>These were the days of Resdaynia, when Chimer and Dwemer lived under the wise and benevolent rule of the
<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">ASV</span>
and their champion the Hortator.\
&#8203;

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup3;</b>'Seek me without effort for I take many shapes.'</span>

<b>&#8308;</b>The Hortator was still trying to subdue the heavens with an axe.
<b>&#8309;</b>He was thrown out of the library of the sun by the power of Magnus.
<b>&#8310;</b>Vivec found him in a grub field outside of the swamps of the Deshaan Plain.
<b>&#8311;</b>They walked for a span in silence, for Nerevar had been humbled and Vivec still had mercy in his hand.

<b>&#8312;</b>Soon they were walking across the eastern sea to the land of snakes and snow demons.
<b>&#8313;</b>Vivec wanted to show the Hortator the fighting styles of foreign tongues.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>They learned the idiom stroke from the pillow book of the Tsaesci king. It is shaped like the insight of this page.
<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>The Tsaesci serpents vowed to have their vengeance on the west at least three times.

<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>They walked farther and saw the spiked waters at the edge of the map.
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>Here the spirit of limitation gifted them with a spoke and bade them find the rest of the wheel.

<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>The Hortator said, 'The edge of the world is made of swords.'

Vivec corrected him. 'They are the bottom row of the world's teeth.'

<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>They walked to the north to the Elder Wood and found nothing but frozen bearded kings.

<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>They came to the west where the black men dwelt.
<b>&sup1;&#8311;</b>For a year they studied under their sword saints and then for another Vivec taught them the virtue of the little reward.
<b>&sup1;&#8312;</b>Vivec chose a king for a wife and made another race of monsters which ended up destroying the west completely.
<b>&sup1;&#8313;</b>To a warrior chief Vivec said:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'We must not act and speak as if asleep.'</span>

<b>&sup2;&#8304;</b>Nerevar wondered if there was anything to learn in the south but Vivec remained silent and only led them back to Red Mountain.

<b>&sup2;&sup1;</b>'Here,' Vivec said, 'is the last of the last. Within it the Sharmat waits.'

<b>&sup2;&sup2;</b>But they both knew that the time was not ready to contest the Sharmat and so they engaged in combat with each other.
<b>&sup2;&sup3;</b>Vivec marked the Hortator in this way for all of the Velothi to see.
<b>&sup2;&#8308;</b>He sealed the wound with the blessing of Ayem-Azura.
<b>&sup2;&#8309;</b>At the end of the battle, the Hortator found that he had gathered seven more spokes.
<b>&sup2;&#8310;</b>He attempted to attach them and form a staff but Vivec would not let him, saying, 'It is not the time for that.'

<b>&sup2;&#8311;</b>Nerevar said, 'Where did I find these?'

Vivec said that they had collected them from around the world, though some had come invisibly.
<b>&sup2;&#8312;</b>'I am the wheel,' he said, and took that shape. Before the emptiness at the center could live too long, Nerevar put in the spokes.

<b>&sup2;&#8313;</b>The ending of the words is
<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">ASV</span>.
