## <span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric">sahna'shoreshik</span>

#### <span style="color:red">Sermon Seven</span>

<img align="left" alt="A" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/vivec/initial_07.svg">s the caravan of Nerevar now made for the capital of Veloth, anon Almalexia, there came great rumblings from the oblivion.
<b>&sup2;</b>A duke among scamps wandered into the House of Troubles, pausing before each scripture door to pay his respects, until finally he was met by the majordomo of Mehrunes Dagon.

<b>&sup3;</b>The Duke of Scamps said, 'I was summoned by Lord Dagon, master of the foul waters and fire, and I have brought the pennants of my seven legions.'

<b>&#8308;</b>The majordomo, whose head was a bubble of foul water and fire, bowed low, so that the head of the Duke of Scamps became enclosed in his own.

<b>&#8309;</b>He saw the first pennant, which commanded a legion of grim warriors who could die at least twice.

<b>&#8310;</b>He saw the second pennant, which commanded a legion of winged bulls and the emperor of color that rode upon each.

<b>&#8311;</b>He saw the third pennant, which commanded a legion of inverted gorgons, great snakes whose scales were the faces of men.

<b>&#8312;</b>He saw the fourth pennant, which commanded a legion of double-crossed lovers.

<b>&#8313;</b>He saw the fifth pennant, which commanded a legion of jumping wounds looking to hop onto a victim.

<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>He saw the sixth pennant, which commanded a legion of abridged planets.

<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>He saw the seventh pennant, which commanded a legion of armored winning moves.

<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>To which the majordomo said, 'Duke Kh-Utta, your legions while mighty are not enough to destroy Nerevar or the Triune way.
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>Look upon the Hortator and see the wisdom he takes to wife.'

<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>And they looked into the middle world and saw:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Evaporating in a throng of thunder</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Of red war and chitin men,</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Where destines</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Take him further from our ways</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>The heat that we have wanted</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">And pray they still remember,</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Where destines</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Clothe the distance,</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>Glad in the golden east that we saw it now,</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Instead of the war and repair</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Of the oblivious fracture</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">A curse on the Hortator</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">And two more on his hands</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8311;</b>And the Duke of Scamps saw the palms of the Hortator, upon which the egg had written these words of power:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">GHARTOK PADHOME GHARTOK PADHOME</span>.</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8312;</b>The ending of the words is
<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">ASV</span>.
