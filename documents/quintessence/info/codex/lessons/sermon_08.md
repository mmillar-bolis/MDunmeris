<img align="left" alt="A" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/vivec/initial_08.svg">nd presently Nerevar and Vivec were within sight of the capital and the Four Corners of the House of Troubles knew that it was not time to contest them.
<b>&sup2;</b>The caravan musicians made a great song of entrance and the eleven gates of the Mourning Hold were thrown wide.

<b>&sup3;</b>Ayem was accompanied by her husband-state, a flickering image that was channeled to her ever-changing female need.
<b>&#8308;</b>Around her were the Shouts, a guild now forgotten, who carried with them the whims of the people, for the Velothi then were still mostly good at heart.
<b>&#8309;</b>The Shouts were the counselors of Ayem and the country, though they sometimes quarreled and needed Seht to wring them into usefulness.
<b>&#8310;</b>Ayem approached Nerevar, who was by now adorned in the flags of House Indoril.
<b>&#8311;</b>He gifted her with the simulacrum of the netchiman's wife and the egg of Vivec inside.

<b>&#8312;</b>Ayem said to Nerevar, 'Seht who is Azura has revealed that war is come and that the Hortator that shall deliver us will approach with a solution walking at his side.'

<b>&#8313;</b>Nerevar said, 'I have traveled out of my way to warn you of the deceit of our enemies, the Dwemer, but I have learned much on the journey and have changed my mind.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>This netchiman's wife you see at my side is a sword and a symbol and there is prophecy inside.
<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>It tells me that, like it, we must for a while be like he is and, as a people, cloaked in our former enemies, and to use their machines without shame.'

<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>At which Vivec spoke aloud, 'Boethiah-who-is-you wore the skin of Trinimac to cleanse the faults of Veloth, my Queen, and so it should be again. This is the walking way of the glorious.'
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>Seht appeared out of a cloud of iron vapor and his minions made of their blood a chair.
<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>He sat beside Ayem and looked on the rebirth of mastery.
<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>Vivec said to them, his Triune:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'My rituals and ordeals and all the rhymes within,</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Use no other motive than the revelation of my skin.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>Ayem said,
'<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">AYEM AE SEHTI AE VEHK</span>.
We are delivered and made whole, the diamond of the Black Hands is uncovered.'

<b>&sup1;&#8311;</b>Seht said, 'Wherever so he treads, there is invisible scripture.'

To which the Shouts were silent in sudden reading.

<b>&sup1;&#8312;</b>Vivec then reached out from the egg all his limbs and features, merging with the simulacrum of his mother, gilled and blended in all the arts of the star-wounded East, under water and in fire and in metal and in ash, six times the wise,
<b>&sup1;&#8313;</b>and he became the union of male and female, the magic hermaphrodite, the martial axiom, the sex-death of language and unique in all the middle world.

<b>&sup2;&#8304;</b>He said, 'Let us now guide the hands of the Hortator in war and its aftermath. For we go different, and in thunder. This is our destiny.'

<b>&sup2;&sup1;</b>The ending of the words is
<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">ASV</span>.
