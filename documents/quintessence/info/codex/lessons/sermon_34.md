#### <span style="color:red">Sermon Thirty-Four</span>

<img align="left" alt="T" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/vivec/initial_34.svg">hen Vivec left the Ministry of Truth and went back to the space that was not a space.
<b>&sup2;</b>From the Provisional House he looked into the middle world to find the eighth and final and mightiest monster,
<b>&sup3;</b>called
<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">GULGA MOR JIL HYAET AE HOOM</span>.

<b>&#8308;</b>Vivec called to his side the Hortator and this was the first time that Nerevar had ever been to the Provisional House.
<b>&#8309;</b>He had the same vision that Vivec had so many years ago: that of the two-headed ruling king.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8310;</b>'Who is that?' he wondered.</span>

Vivec said, 'The red jewel of conquest.'

<b>&#8311;</b>Nerevar, perhaps because he was frightened, became vexed at his lord's answer. 'Why are you always so evasive?'

<b>&#8312;</b>Vivec told the Hortator that to be otherwise was to betray his nature.

<b>&#8313;</b>Together they moved into the middle world, to a village near where Vivec had been found by Ayem and Seht.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>The eighth monster was there, but he did not act much like a monster. He sat with his legs in the ocean and with a troubled look on his face.
<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>When he saw his mother-father, he asked why he should have to die and return to oblivion.

<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>Vivec told the eighth monster that to be otherwise was to betray his nature.
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>Since this did not seem to satisfy the monster and Vivec still had a touch of Ayem's mercy he said:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The fire is mine: let it consume thee,</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>And make a secret door</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">At the altar of Padhome,</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">In the House of Boet-hi-Ah</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Where we become safe</span>\
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">And looked after.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>The monster accepted Muatra with a peaceful look and his bones became the foundation for the City of the Dead, anon Necrom.

<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>Nerevar put away his axe, which he had at the ready, and frowned.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'Why,' he said, 'did you ask me to come if you knew the eighth monster would give in so easily?'</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8311;</b>Vivec looked at the Hortator for a long time.

Nerevar understood. 'Do not betray your nature. Answer as you will.'

<b>&sup1;&#8312;</b>Vivec said, 'I brought you here because I knew the mightiest of my issue would succumb to Muatra without argument, if only I gave him consolation first.'

<b>&sup1;&#8313;</b>Nerevar looked at Vivec for a long time.

Vivec understood. 'Say the words, Hortator.'

Nerevar said, 'Now I am the mightiest of your children.'

<b>&sup2;&#8304;</b>Let this sermon be consolation to those who read it that are destined to die.

<b>&sup2;&sup1;</b>The ending of the words is
<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">ASV</span>.
