<img align="left" alt="T" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/vivec/initial_21.svg">he Scripture of the Wheel,

First:

'The Spokes are the eight components of chaos, as yet solidified by the law of time:
<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup2;</b>static change, if you will, something the lizard gods refer to as the Striking.
<b>&sup3;</b>That is the reptile wheel, coiled potential, ever-preamble to the never-action.'</span>

<b>&#8308;</b>Second:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'They are the lent bones of the Aedra, the Eight gift-limbs to
<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">SITHISIT</span>,
the wet earth of the new star our home.
<b>&#8309;</b>Outside them is the Aurbis, and not within. Like most things inexplicable, it is a circle.
<b>&#8310;</b>Circles are confused serpents, striking and striking and never given leave to bite.
<b>&#8311;</b>The Aedra would have you believe different, but they were givers before liars. Lies have turned them into biters.
<b>&#8312;</b>Their teeth are the proselytizers; to convert is to place oneself in the mouth of falsehood; even to propitiate is to be swallowed.'</span>

<b>&#8313;</b>Third:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The enlightened are those uneaten by the world.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>Fourth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The spaces between the gift-limbs number sixteen, the signal shapes of the Demon Princedoms. It is the key and the lock, series and manticore.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>Fifth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'Look at the majesty sideways and all you see is the Tower, which our ancestors made idols from.
<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>Look at its center and all you see is the begotten hole, second serpent, womb-ready for the Right Reaching, exact and without enchantment.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>Sixth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The heart of the second serpent holds the secret triangular gate.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>Seventh:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'Look at the secret triangular gate sideways and you see the secret Tower.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>Eighth:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The secret Tower within the Tower is the shape of the only name of God, I.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>The ending of the words is
<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">ASV</span>.
