#### <span style="color:red">Sermon Four</span>

<img align="left" alt="T" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/vivec/initial_04.svg">he simulacrum of the netchiman's wife who carried the egg of Vivec within it went back to looking for the lands of the Indoril.
<b>&sup2;</b>Along the journey many more spirits came to see it and offer instructions to its son-daughter, the future glorious invisible warrior-poet of Vvardenfell, Vivec.

<b>&sup3;</b>A troupe of spirits called the Lobbyists for the Coincidence Guild appeared.
<b>&#8308;</b>Vivec understood the challenge immediately and said:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'The popular notion of God kills happenstance.'</span>

<b>&#8309;</b>The head of the Lobbyists, whose name is forgotten, tried to defend the concept's existence.
<b>&#8310;</b>He said, 'Saying something at the same time can be magical.'

<b>&#8311;</b>Vivec knew that to retain his divinity that he must make a strong argument against luck.
<b>&#8312;</b>He said:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'Is not the sudden revelation of corresponding conditions and disparate elements that gel at the moment of the coincidence one of the prerequisites to being, in fact, coincidental?
<b>&#8313;</b>Synchronicity comes out of repeated coincidences at the lowest level.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>Further examination shows it is the utter power of the sheer number of coincidences that leads one to the idea that synchronicity is guided by something more than chance.
<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>Therefore, synchronicity ends up invalidating the concept of the coincidental, even though they are the symptomatic signs that bring it to the surface.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>Thus was coincidence destroyed in the land of the Velothi.

<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>Then an Old Bone of the earth rose up before the simulacrum of the netchiman's wife and said,
<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>'If you are to be born a ruling king of the world you must confuse it with new words. Set me into pondering.'

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>'Very well,' Vivec said, 'Let me talk to you of the world, which I share with mystery and love. Who is her capital? Have you taken the scenic route of her cameo?
<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>I have\-\- lightly, in secret, missing candles because they're on the untrue side, and run my hand along the edge of a shadow made from one hundred and three divisions of warmth, and left no proof.'</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8311;</b>At this the Old Bone folded unto itself twenty times until it became akin to milk, which Vivec drank, becoming a ruling king of the world.

<b>&sup1;&#8312;</b>Finally the Chancellor of Exactitude appeared, and he was perfect to look upon from every angle.
<b>&sup1;&#8313;</b>Vivec understood the challenge immediately and said:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">'Certitude is for the puzzle-box logicians and girls of white glamour who harbor it on their own time. I am a letter written in uncertainty.'</span>

<b>&sup2;&#8304;</b>The Chancellor bowed his head and smiled fifty different and perfect ways all at once.
<b>&sup2;&sup1;</b>He pulled the astrolabe of the universe from his robe and broke it in half, handing both halves to the egg-image of Vivec.

<b>&sup2;&sup2;</b>Vivec laughed and said, 'Yes, I know. The slave labor of the senses is as selfish as polar ice, and worsens when energies are spent on a life others regard as fortunate.
<b>&sup2;&sup3;</b>To be a ruling king I will have to suffer much that cannot be suffered, and to weigh matters that no astrolabe or compass can measure.'

<b>&sup2;&#8308;</b>The ending of the words is
<span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">ASV</span>.
