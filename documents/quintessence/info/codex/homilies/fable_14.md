__The Child of the Councilor__

<img align="left" alt="O" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_o.svg">ne summer's day, a councilor was walking along the market in her splendid regalia, attended by her many servants.
<b>&sup2;</b>She was so splendid that a small mer in the crowd told his mother,

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:1em">"I wish my mother was a councilor, instead of you!"</span>

<b>&sup3;</b>The little mer never expected the councilor to hear him, nor did he expect her to turn toward him in the crowd.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8308;</b>"I have heard your wish, little one, and I accept," she told the open-mouthed little mer.
<b>&#8309;</b>"You will be my child, and you will have all that you wish."</span>

<b>&#8310;</b>The little mer was immediately taken to the councilor's manor and placed in a room with toys and sweets.
<b>&#8311;</b>He laughed and clapped his hands, playing and eating all he wished. But soon he grew bored and went to speak to a servant.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8312;</b>"It's no fun playing by myself," he told the servant. "Can I have someone to play with?"</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8313;</b>"The child of the councilor has no equal," the servant told him. "There is none worthy to play with you."</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>The little mer had little time to think on this when a scholar came to his room.
<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>The scholar looked upon the little mer with scorn and said,

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">"Your lessons should have begun hours ago! The child of the councilor must know many great things."</span>

<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>The little mer was made to listen to the scholar's lectures for hours and hours, and soon his head ached with all that he was to know.

<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>Eventually it was time for dinner, but the little mer's troubles were not over.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">"In those clothes? In that state?" cried his servant, horrified.
<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>"You must be washed and clothed if you are to be presented as the child of the councilor!"</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>And so the little mer was scrubbed roughly and forced into very uncomfortable clothes.

<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>By this point the little mer was almost in tears. He missed his home, and his clothes, and his friends. But most of all he missed his mother, who he had never gone a day without.

<b>&sup1;&#8311;</b>When the little mer was finally sent to the dining hall, he was met with a surprise. Seated at the dining table was his family, all laughing and smiling.
<b>&sup1;&#8312;</b>He ran to his mother's arms and cried,

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">"I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I want you to be my mother after all!"</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8313;</b>The councilor, who was seated at the head of the table, smiled and told the little mer,

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">"You have learned a very important lesson, my child.
<b>&sup2;&#8304;</b>We often forget to be thankful for what we have, when thinking only of what we want."</span>
