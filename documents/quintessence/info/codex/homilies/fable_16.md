__The Strongest Nix-Ox__

<img align="left" alt="A" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_a.svg"> great nix-ox trumpeted to its herd, "None of you love the master more than I! Do you see what great burdens I bear?"

<b>&sup2;</b>"But you are twice our size!" the lesser nix-oxen grumbled. "Better for us to carry four bales of saltrice than struggle with six and risk great injury."

<b>&sup3;</b>"Bah!" the mighty nix-ox snorted. "It's hard work you fear, not injury." The great beast took up its yoke and trudged out into the field.

<b>&#8308;</b>The lesser nix-oxen gathered by a fence and watched their mighty brother take up two bales of saltrice, then four bales, then six, eight, ten!
<b>&#8309;</b>Until at last, the great nix-ox was laden with twelve full bales.

<b>&#8310;</b>"Do you see?" it said, straining for breath. "None of you love the master more than I!"

<b>&#8311;</b>Just then, the nix-ox's shell began to crack under the weight.
<b>&#8312;</b>It let out a painful bellow and collapsed under the bales&mdash;crushed to death.

<b>&#8313;</b>The lesser nix-oxen sighed and shook their heads.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>"Poor fool. He learned too late that there is no mortal strength without limits."
