__The Gifted Guar__

<img align="left" alt="O" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_o.svg">ne day a farmer decided to give his daughter a gift. She had started a family of her own, and he wished good fortune for her.
<b>&sup2;</b>He chose his finest guar and brought it to his daughter's new home.

<b>&sup3;</b>His daughter was delighted at this gift, but her husband only glared.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8308;</b>"You didn't even let us choose?" the husband asked angrily.
<b>&#8309;</b>"What if this guar is sick, or old, or weak? I must at least inspect it before it's left in our care!"</span>

<b>&#8310;</b>The daughter tried to calm her husband, but the farmer simply nodded and said, "You may examine this guar as you see fit."

<b>&#8311;</b>The husband inspected every inch of the guar, even forcing the beast to open its mighty jaws to look at the state of its teeth.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8312;</b>"Well, it will have to do," the husband conceded, though he knew it was a fine guar indeed.</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8313;</b>The farmer stroked his chin. "You know, I think you're right. You should be able to pick whichever guar you wish. I know there's plenty for sale in the local market."</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>The husband simply gaped as his father-in-law walked back home, guar in hand.

<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>His wife slapped her husband's arm and told him, "You fool! Never look a gift guar in the mouth!"
