__The Guar and the Mudcrabs__

<img align="left" alt="T" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_t.svg">he Guar were so tormented by the other creatures they did not know where to go.
<b>&sup2;</b>As soon as they saw a single beast approach them, off they dashed in terror.

<b>&sup3;</b>One day they saw a pack of Nix-hounds ranging about, and in a desperate panic all the Guar scuttled off towards the sea, determined to drown themselves rather than live in such a continual state of fear.
<b>&#8308;</b>But just as they got near the shoreline, a colony of Mudcrabs, frightened in their turn by the approach of the Guar, scuttled off, and threw themselves into the water.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8309;</b>"Truly," said one of the Guar, "things are not so bad as they seem. For there is always someone worse off than you."</span>
