__The Crow and the Netch__

<img align="left" alt="O" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_o.svg">ne day a curious crow decided to fly farther than he ever flew before.
<b>&sup2;</b>He flew and flew and finally came upon a creature that he found very strange.

<b>&sup3;</b>"Friend!" he called as he flew by the creature. "Friend, what is it that you are? I have never seen a flying beast such as you!"

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8308;</b>"They call me a netch," the good netch replied.</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8309;</b>"A netch! A netch! That's quite the catch!" the crow cackled. "Tell me, netch, how is it that you fly?"</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8310;</b>"I've flown these shores since I was born," the netch replied. "I do not know how."</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8311;</b>"Don't know, don't know, oh what a show!" the crow called out. "Where are your glossy feathers that help you glide?"</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8312;</b>"I have no need of feathers to glide," the netch explained, "but I have a strong, thick hide to protect me."</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8313;</b>"A hide! A hide! Oh, what a find," the crow mocked. "Tell me netch, where are your eyes?"</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>"I need no eyes to sail the skies, as you can plainly see," the netch once more replied.</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>"No eyes, no eyes, to sail the skies!" the prideful crow continued. "But it makes you far uglier than I!"
<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>And he began to laugh at the netch's misfortune.</span>

The crow's laughter grew louder and louder, eventually attracting a nearby cliff-racer.
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>The beast swooped down upon the crow, swallowing him whole, and he could mock the netch no more.

<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>The netch simply sighed and said,

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">"Mocking others is for naught, for none can change their own weakness."</span>
