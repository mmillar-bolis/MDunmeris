__Vivec and the Cripple__

<img align="left" alt="L" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_l.svg">ord Vivec, while walking down a road, came upon a cripple with a gnarled and withered hand.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:1em"><b>&sup2;</b>"Young bravo!" the cripple cried, "Will you not help an oathman in need?"</span>

<b>&sup3;</b>Vivec stood before the cripple and furrowed his brow.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">"What is wrong with you, old mer?" he queried.</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8308;</b>The cripple lifted his hand and replied, "Do you not see my withered hand? It is twisted as old roots and pains me greatly when the storms roll in.
<b>&#8309;</b>Women shun me because of its ugliness, and children run at the sight of it. Please, have pity!"</span>

<b>&#8310;</b>Vivec stood quiet for a moment, then drew his bright sword and severed the mer's hand in one clean stroke.
<b>&#8311;</b>The cripple howled in pain as the warrior-poet dressed the wound.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8312;</b>"Do not bawl so, old mer," said Vivec. "Do you not see that I have done you the greatest kindness?
<b>&#8313;</b>Better to be done with an evil than to carry it on for pity's sake."</span>
