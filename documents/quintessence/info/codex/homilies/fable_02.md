__Lord Vivec and the Contentious Beasts__

<img align="left" alt="A" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_a.svg"> shalk and a kagouti were strutting back and forth in a foyada, casting aspersions of one another's looks.

<b>&sup2;</b>"You are the ugliest creature alive," the shalk told the kagouti.
<b>&sup3;</b>"No, you are the ugliest creature alive!" the kagouti told the shalk.

<b>&#8308;</b>For each thought himself most handsome, and the other most ugly.
<b>&#8309;</b>Then Lord Vivec chanced by, and settled their dispute.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8310;</b>"No, you both are the ugliest creatures alive! I will not have my pleasant sojourn spoiled by your unseemly squabbling."</span>

<b>&#8311;</b>So he dealt them both mighty blows, shattering their skulls, and silencing their argument, and went merrily upon his way.
<b>&#8312;</b>And thus Lord Vivec proved that ugliness is as much in one's manner as in one's appearance.
