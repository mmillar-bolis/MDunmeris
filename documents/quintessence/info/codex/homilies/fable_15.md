__Sotha Sil and the Stars__

<img align="left" alt="Y" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_y.svg">oung Sotha Sil lay upon a patch of moss and gazed up at the stars. Driven by his great love of maths, his mind turned to counting.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:1em"><b>&sup2;</b>"I shall count every star and give each a name!" he resolved.</span>

<b>&sup3;</b>For hours he counted and named until, at length, his eyes tired and he drifted off to sleep.

<b>&#8308;</b>When morning came, Sotha Sil woke with a start and looked up at the sky. Alas, all the stars had vanished.
<b>&#8309;</b>He buried his face in his hands and began to weep, for he had learned a harsh lesson.
<b>&#8310;</b>You see, child, time cages all tasks.
