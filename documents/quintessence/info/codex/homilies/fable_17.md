__The Tale of the Frozen Guar__

<img align="left" alt="A" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_a.svg"> lonely guar struggled through the Ashlands on a cold, moonless night. The wind was frosty and bitter and chilled the animal to the bone.
<b>&sup2;</b>"Alas!" it cried, "I will die here, alone in the cold."

<b>&sup3;</b>Just then, the guar caught sight of a faint orange glow in the distance.

<b>&#8308;</b>"A campfire?" it barked hopefully, "It must be! It must be!"

<b>&#8309;</b>The guar raced toward the light, its feet growing warmer with every step. Soon, the cold gave way to a sweltering heat.
<b>&#8310;</b>The air grew thick and acrid, searing the guar's nostrils and lungs.
<b>&#8311;</b>But still, it hurried on, barking, "It must be a campfire! It must be! It must be!"

<b>&#8312;</b>Finally, the guar reached the orange glow. Alas, it was not a campfire, but a great flow of lava.
<b>&#8313;</b>The guar, so seduced by the warmth, gave this truth no heed. It sprinted to the lava's edge and tripped on a loose stone.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>With one last joyful bark, the beast landed headfirst in the fiery liquid and died.

<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>So you see, child, a fool's thirst for safety carries its own risks.
