__Almalexia and the Mudcrab__

<img align="left" alt="T" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_t.svg">here was once a mudcrab who suffered much.
<b>&sup2;</b>He had a limp and a hacking cough. His shell was misshapen, causing him pain. He was weary at all times, and told everyone he was surely dying.
<b>&sup3;</b>He roamed the valley one day, complaining to any who would listen.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8308;</b>The shalk created a brace from part of his shell and offered it to the mudcrab. "Here, mudcrab, try bracing your leg," he advised.</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8309;</b>"No, no, no," said the mudcrab, "I have tried that and it does not work."</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8310;</b>"Mudcrab," said the alit, "let me bite on your shell and crack it just a bit to relieve the pressure."</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8311;</b>The mudcrab said, "You are trying to trick me, alit! You just want an easy snack!"</span>

<b>&#8312;</b>Almalexia, who was roaming the land that day, heard these conversations and entered the valley, where she appeared as a humble guar.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8313;</b>"Mudcrab," she said, "take this draught I have made for your cough."</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>"Guar, you are not a healer. It is better to suffer than risk a poor remedy," replied the mudcrab.</span>

<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>And Almalexia revealed herself to the creatures, who gasped in surprise.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>"Mudcrab," she said, "all of these creatures have offered you help, but you refuse. You are in love with complaining, and you will never be healed."</span>

<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>And so Almalexia teaches us that you cannot aid the unwilling.
