__The Most Beautiful Netch__

<img align="left" alt="A" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_a.svg"> netch mother once said to her calf, "You, my darling, are the most beautiful netchling in all these isles. No bull is worthy of you!"

<b>&sup2;</b>For years the netch's vanity grew. Many worthy bulls approached her with loving intent, but she rebuffed them all,
<b>&sup3;</b>saying, "Do you not know that I am the most beautiful netch in all these isles? None of you are worthy of me!"

<b>&#8308;</b>At length, the netch grew old and weary. "Alas, I shall die alone!" she cried.

<b>&#8309;</b>A young netch couple passed her by and sighed at her wretched condition. "We must be cautious with our calves," the betty said.
<b>&#8310;</b>"Smothering a child with praise does nothing but harm."
