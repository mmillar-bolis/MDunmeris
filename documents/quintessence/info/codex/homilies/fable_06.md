__The Wounded Netch__

<img align="left" alt="A" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_a.svg"> wounded Netch lay himself down in a quiet corner of his feeding-ground.
<b>&sup2;</b>His healthy companions came in great numbers to inquire after his health, yet each one helped himself to a share of the fodder which had been placed there for his use;
<b>&sup3;</b>so that the poor Netch died, not from his wounds, but from the greed and carelessness of his erstwhile friends.

<b>&#8308;</b>And so it is clear that thoughtless companions may bring more harm than help.
