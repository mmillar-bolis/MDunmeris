__The Tallest Shroom Beetle__

<img align="left" alt="A" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_a.svg"> shroom beetle, lamenting its small stature, crawled to the top of a great mushroom.
<b>&sup2;</b>It gazed out over the Ashlands and cried, "Ha! There is no shroom beetle taller than I! There is nothing I cannot see!"

<b>&sup3;</b>Just then, a cliff racer swooped down and plucked the beetle from its perch.
<b>&#8308;</b>The beast grinned a wide toothy grin and said, "Had you stayed on the ground, I never would have seen you. Is it not better to be short than dead?"

<b>&#8309;</b>Alas, the beetle learned too late that forsaking one's nature brings nothing but ruin.
