__The Tale of Two Herders__

<img align="left" alt="T" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_t.svg">wo guar herders met in the market square, preparing to sell their stock.
<b>&sup2;</b>The shorter of the two laughed at the other and jeered,\
\
"You bring only one guar to market?
<b>&sup3;</b>Look upon my herd! I have brought ten and twenty and stand to make a fortune!"

<b>&#8308;</b>The tall herder merely shook his head.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">"You may have ten and twenty guars, but they are scrawny and frail.
<b>&#8309;</b>Better to have one steady beast than a hundred sickly ones."</span>

<b>&#8310;</b>The short herder released an oafish chuckle and prepared to usher his beasts into the pens.
<b>&#8311;</b>Just then, a great ash storm arrived and pummeled the market with howling winds and choking fumes.

Eventually, the storm relented.
<b>&#8312;</b>The tall herder and his great, strong guar were unharmed, but the short herder's guars were thrown this way and that, and not one of them had survived.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8313;</b>"Do you see now, my friend?" the tall herdsman said. "Numbers are no substitute for quality."</span>
