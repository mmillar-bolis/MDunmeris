__Sotha Sil and the Scribs__

<b>&sup2;</b>and he began to cast stones upon them, snickering as they skittered and scattered, until one of the scribs, lifting its head up in agony, cried out to Sotha Sil:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup3;</b>"Please, please, have mercy, little boy, for what is sport to you is suffering and death to us."</span>

<b>&#8308;</b>And so Sotha Sil discovered that the idle of amusements of one may be the solemn tortures of another.

__Lord Vivec and the Contentious Beasts__

<img align="left" alt="A" src="../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_a.svg"> shalk and a kagouti were strutting back and forth in a foyada, casting aspersions of one another's looks.

<b>&sup2;</b>"You are the ugliest creature alive," the shalk told the kagouti.
<b>&sup3;</b>"No, you are the ugliest creature alive!" the kagouti told the shalk.

<b>&#8308;</b>For each thought himself most handsome, and the other most ugly.
<b>&#8309;</b>Then Lord Vivec chanced by, and settled their dispute.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8310;</b>"No, you both are the ugliest creatures alive! I will not have my pleasant sojourn spoiled by your unseemly squabbling."</span>

<b>&#8311;</b>So he dealt them both mighty blows, shattering their skulls, and silencing their argument, and went merrily upon his way.
<b>&#8312;</b>And thus Lord Vivec proved that ugliness is as much in one's manner as in one's appearance.

__The Boiled Kagouti__

<img align="left" alt="I" src="../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_i.svg">t is said that if a kagouti steps into a boiling pool, he will leap out immediately to avoid harm.

<b>&sup2;</b>But if the kagouti is standing in a pool, and a wizard slowly raises the temperature, measure by measure, to boiling, the kagouti will calmly stand in place until he is boiled.

<b>&sup3;</b>Thus we see that we must be alert not only to the obvious danger, but also to the subtle degrees by which change may result in danger.

<b>&sup3;</b>then asked him,

<b>&sup2;</b>As soon as they saw a single beast approach them, off they dashed in terror.

<b>&sup3;</b>One day they saw a pack of Nix-hounds ranging about, and in a desperate panic all the Guar scuttled off towards the sea, determined to drown themselves rather than live in such a continual state of fear.
<b>&#8308;</b>But just as they got near the shoreline, a colony of Mudcrabs, frightened in their turn by the approach of the Guar, scuttled off, and threw themselves into the water.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8309;</b>"Truly," said one of the Guar, "things are not so bad as they seem. For there is always someone worse off than you."</span>

<b>&#8308;</b>And so it is clear that thoughtless companions may bring more harm than help.

__Almalexia and the Mudcrab__

<img align="left" alt="T" src="../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_t.svg">here was once a mudcrab who suffered much.
<b>&sup2;</b>He had a limp and a hacking cough. His shell was misshapen, causing him pain. He was weary at all times, and told everyone he was surely dying.
<b>&sup3;</b>He roamed the valley one day, complaining to any who would listen.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8308;</b>The shalk created a brace from part of his shell and offered it to the mudcrab. "Here, mudcrab, try bracing your leg," he advised.</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8309;</b>"No, no, no," said the mudcrab, "I have tried that and it does not work."</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8310;</b>"Mudcrab," said the alit, "let me bite on your shell and crack it just a bit to relieve the pressure."</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8311;</b>The mudcrab said, "You are trying to trick me, alit! You just want an easy snack!"</span>

<b>&#8312;</b>Almalexia, who was roaming the land that day, heard these conversations and entered the valley, where she appeared as a humble guar.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8313;</b>"Mudcrab," she said, "take this draught I have made for your cough."</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>"Guar, you are not a healer. It is better to suffer than risk a poor remedy," replied the mudcrab.</span>

<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>And Almalexia revealed herself to the creatures, who gasped in surprise.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>"Mudcrab," she said, "all of these creatures have offered you help, but you refuse. You are in love with complaining, and you will never be healed."</span>

<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>And so Almalexia teaches us that you cannot aid the unwilling.

<b>&sup2;</b>It gazed out over the Ashlands and cried, "Ha! There is no shroom beetle taller than I! There is nothing I cannot see!"

<b>&sup3;</b>Just then, a cliff racer swooped down and plucked the beetle from its perch.
<b>&#8308;</b>The beast grinned a wide toothy grin and said, "Had you stayed on the ground, I never would have seen you. Is it not better to be short than dead?"

<b>&#8309;</b>Alas, the beetle learned too late that forsaking one's nature brings nothing but ruin.

<b>&#8308;</b>The tall herder merely shook his head.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">"You may have ten and twenty guars, but they are scrawny and frail.

<b>&#8310;</b>The short herder released an oafish chuckle and prepared to usher his beasts into the pens.
<b>&#8311;</b>Just then, a great ash storm arrived and pummeled the market with howling winds and choking fumes. Eventually, the storm relented.

<b>&#8312;</b>The tall herder and his great, strong guar were unharmed, but the short herder's guars were thrown this way and that, and not one of them had survived.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8313;</b>"Do you see now, my friend?" the tall herdsman said. "Numbers are no substitute for quality."</span>

__The Friendly Alit__

<img align="left" alt="A" src="../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_a.svg"> jovial alit pranced across the Ashlands, ever watchful for a beast it could call "friend."
<b>&sup2;</b>Presently it came upon a nix-hound who was preening itself in an ashpit. The alit smiled a great smile and cried out, "Greetings, friend!"
<b>&sup3;</b>The nix-hound, seeing the alit's huge teeth, panicked and dashed under a rock. The alit sighed and pranced on.

<b>&#8308;</b>In due course it came upon a vvardvark rooting through a beetle-nest. "Hello!" the alit shouted, smiling widely and revealing its huge, sharp teeth.
<b>&#8309;</b>The vvardvark squealed in terror and scampered off into the bushes. The alit released another mournful sigh, and trundled on toward the shore.

<b>&#8310;</b>Finally, it spotted an ash-hopper rolling in the sand. The alit summoned up its widest, most cheerful smile and said, "Hail, ash-hopper!"
<b>&#8311;</b>The ash-hopper leapt back in horror and sprung away as fast as it could.

The alit was heartbroken.
<b>&#8312;</b>"I will never have a friend as long as I have these terrible teeth!" it hissed.
<b>&#8313;</b>The beast resolved to be done with them altogether. It took a huge rock in its mouth and bit down hard&mdash;knocking out all its teeth like a box of loose nails.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>"Finally," it sighed "other beasts will no longer be afraid!"

<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>Just then a great Kagouti arrived, stomping its feet and preparing to pounce. The alit growled and opened its wide jaws to frighten the predator away, but the kagouti just laughed.
<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>"You fool! You've no teeth left in your head!"
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>The alit realized its folly too late. The kagouti lunged and swallowed the cheerful beast in one huge gulp.

<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>So you see, child&mdash;that which we hate in ourselves is often our greatest gift.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:1em"><b>&sup2;</b>"Young bravo!" the cripple cried, "Will you not help an oathman in need?"</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8308;</b>The cripple lifted his hand and replied, "Do you not see my withered hand? It is twisted as old roots and pains me greatly when the storms roll in.

<b>&#8310;</b>Vivec stood quiet for a moment, then drew his bright sword and severed the mer's hand in one clean stroke.
<b>&#8311;</b>The cripple howled in pain as the warrior-poet dressed the wound.

<b>&sup2;</b>He flew and flew and finally came upon a creature that he found very strange.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8308;</b>"They call me a netch," the good netch replied.</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8309;</b>"A netch! A netch! That's quite the catch!" the crow cackled. "Tell me, netch, how is it that you fly?"</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8310;</b>"I've flown these shores since I was born," the netch replied. "I do not know how."</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8311;</b>"Don't know, don't know, oh what a show!" the crow called out. "Where are your glossy feathers that help you glide?"</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8312;</b>"I have no need of feathers to glide," the netch explained, "but I have a strong, thick hide to protect me."</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8313;</b>"A hide! A hide! Oh, what a find," the crow mocked. "Tell me netch, where are your eyes?"</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>"I need no eyes to sail the skies, as you can plainly see," the netch once more replied.</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>"No eyes, no eyes, to sail the skies!" the prideful crow continued. "But it makes you far uglier than I!"
<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>And he began to laugh at the netch's misfortune.</span>

The crow's laughter grew louder and louder, eventually attracting a nearby cliff-racer.
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>The beast swooped down upon the crow, swallowing him whole, and he could mock the netch no more.

<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>The netch simply sighed and said,

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">"Mocking others is for naught, for none can change their own weakness."</span>

<b>&#8310;</b>The daughter tried to calm her husband, but the farmer simply nodded and said, "You may examine this guar as you see fit."

<b>&#8311;</b>The husband inspected every inch of the guar, even forcing the beast to open its mighty jaws to look at the state of its teeth.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8312;</b>"Well, it will have to do," the husband conceded, though he knew it was a fine guar indeed.</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:1em">"I wish my mother was a councilor, instead of you!"</span>

<b>&#8309;</b>"You will be my child, and you will have all that you wish."</span>

<b>&#8310;</b>The little mer was immediately taken to the councilor's manor and placed in a room with toys and sweets.
<b>&#8311;</b>He laughed and clapped his hands, playing and eating all he wished. But soon he grew bored and went to speak to a servant.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8312;</b>"It's no fun playing by myself," he told the servant. "Can I have someone to play with?"</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8313;</b>"The child of the councilor has no equal," the servant told him. "There is none worthy to play with you."</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>The little mer had little time to think on this when a scholar came to his room.
<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>The scholar looked upon the little mer with scorn and said,

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">"Your lessons should have begun hours ago! The child of the councilor must know many great things."</span>

<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>The little mer was made to listen to the scholar's lectures for hours and hours, and soon his head ached with all that he was to know.

<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>Eventually it was time for dinner, but the little mer's troubles were not over.

But most of all he missed his mother, who he had never gone a day without.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">"I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I want you to be my mother after all!"</span>

<b>&sup1;&#8313;</b>The councilor, who was seated at the head of the table, smiled and told the little mer,

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">"You have learned a very important lesson, my child.
<b>&sup2;&#8304;</b>We often forget to be thankful for what we have, when thinking only of what we want."</span>

__Sotha Sil and the Stars__

<img align="left" alt="Y" src="../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_y.svg">oung Sotha Sil lay upon a patch of moss and gazed up at the stars. Driven by his great love of maths, his mind turned to counting.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:1em"><b>&sup2;</b>"I shall count every star and give each a name!" he resolved.</span>

<b>&sup3;</b>For hours he counted and named until, at length, his eyes tired and he drifted off to sleep.

<b>&#8308;</b>When morning came, Sotha Sil woke with a start and looked up at the sky. Alas, all the stars had vanished.
<b>&#8309;</b>He buried his face in his hands and began to weep, for he had learned a harsh lesson.
<b>&#8310;</b>You see, child, time cages all tasks.

__The Strongest Nix-Ox__

<img align="left" alt="A" src="../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_a.svg"> great nix-ox trumpeted to its herd, "None of you love the master more than I! Do you see what great burdens I bear?"

<b>&sup2;</b>"But you are twice our size!" the lesser nix-oxen grumbled. "Better for us to carry four bales of saltrice than struggle with six and risk great injury."

<b>&sup3;</b>"Bah!" the mighty nix-ox snorted. "It's hard work you fear, not injury." The great beast took up its yoke and trudged out into the field.

<b>&#8308;</b>The lesser nix-oxen gathered by a fence and watched their mighty brother take up two bales of saltrice, then four bales, then six, eight, ten!
<b>&#8309;</b>Until at last, the great nix-ox was laden with twelve full bales.

<b>&#8310;</b>"Do you see?" it said, straining for breath. "None of you love the master more than I!"

<b>&#8311;</b>Just then, the nix-ox's shell began to crack under the weight.
<b>&#8312;</b>It let out a painful bellow and collapsed under the bales&mdash;crushed to death.

<b>&#8313;</b>The lesser nix-oxen sighed and shook their heads.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>"Poor fool. He learned too late that there is no mortal strength without limits."

__The Tale of the Frozen Guar__

<img align="left" alt="A" src="../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_a.svg"> lonely guar struggled through the Ashlands on a cold, moonless night. The wind was frosty and bitter and chilled the animal to the bone.
<b>&sup2;</b>"Alas!" it cried, "I will die here, alone in the cold."

<b>&sup3;</b>Just then, the guar caught sight of a faint orange glow in the distance.

<b>&#8308;</b>"A campfire?" it barked hopefully, "It must be! It must be!"

<b>&#8309;</b>The guar raced toward the light, its feet growing warmer with every step. Soon, the cold gave way to a sweltering heat.
<b>&#8310;</b>The air grew thick and acrid, searing the guar's nostrils and lungs.
<b>&#8311;</b>But still, it hurried on, barking, "It must be a campfire! It must be! It must be!"

<b>&#8312;</b>Finally, the guar reached the orange glow. Alas, it was not a campfire, but a great flow of lava.
<b>&#8313;</b>The guar, so seduced by the warmth, gave this truth no heed. It sprinted to the lava's edge and tripped on a loose stone.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>With one last joyful bark, the beast landed headfirst in the fiery liquid and died.

<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>So you see, child, a fool's thirst for safety carries its own risks.

__The Most Beautiful Netch__

<img align="left" alt="A" src="../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_a.svg"> netch mother once said to her calf, "You, my darling, are the most beautiful netchling in all these isles. No bull is worthy of you!"

<b>&sup2;</b>For years the netch's vanity grew. Many worthy bulls approached her with loving intent, but she rebuffed them all,
<b>&sup3;</b>saying, "Do you not know that I am the most beautiful netch in all these isles? None of you are worthy of me!"

<b>&#8308;</b>At length, the netch grew old and weary. "Alas, I shall die alone!" she cried.

<b>&#8309;</b>A young netch couple passed her by and sighed at her wretched condition. "We must be cautious with our calves," the betty said.
<b>&#8310;</b>"Smothering a child with praise does nothing but harm."
