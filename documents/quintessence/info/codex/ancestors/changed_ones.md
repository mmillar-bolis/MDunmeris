<img align="left" alt="O" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_o.svg">f all the et'Ada who wandered Nirn, Trinimac was the strongest.
<b>&sup2;</b>He, for a very long time, fooled the Aldmeri into thinking that tears were the best response to the Sundering.
<b>&sup3;</b>They cried and shamed our ancestors, especially the feeble Altmer. They even took the Missing God's name in vain, calling His narratives into question.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&#8308;</b>So one day Boethiah, Prince of Plots, precocious youth, tricked Trinimac to go into his mouth.
<b>&#8309;</b>Boethiah talked like Trinimac for awhile then, and gathered enough people to listen to him.
<b>&#8310;</b>Boethiah showed them the lies of the et'Ada, the Aedra, and told them Trinimac was the biggest liar of all, saying all this with Trinimac's voice!
<b>&#8311;</b>Boethiah told the mass before him the Tri-Angled Truth. He showed them, with Mephala, the rules of Psijic Endeavor.
<b>&#8312;</b>He taught them how to build Houses, and what items they needed to bury in the Corners.
<b>&#8313;</b>He demonstrated the right way to wear their skin.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>He performed the way to walk to achieve an Exodus.</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em"><b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>Then Boethiah relieved himself of Trinimac right there on the ground before them to prove all the things he said were the truth.</span>

<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>It was easy then for his new people to become the Changed Ones.
