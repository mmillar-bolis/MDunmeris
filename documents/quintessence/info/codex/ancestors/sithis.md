## <span style="font-family:HayghinDaedric">sithisit</Span>

#### <span style="color:red">Sithis</span>

<img align="left" alt="S" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_s.svg">ithis is the start of the house. Before him was nothing,
<b>&sup2;</b>but the foolish Aldmer have names for and revere this nothing. That is because they are lazy slaves.
<b>&sup3;</b>Indeed, from the Sermons,

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:1em">'stasis asks merely for itself, which is nothing.'</span>

<b>&#8308;</b>Sithis sundered the nothing and mutated the parts, fashioning from them a myriad of possibilities.
<b>&#8309;</b>These ideas ebbed and flowed and faded away and this is how it should have been.

<b>&#8310;</b>One idea, however, became jealous and did not want to die; like the stasis, he wanted to last.
<b>&#8311;</b>This was the demon Anui-El, who made friends, and they called themselves the Aedra.
<b>&#8312;</b>They enslaved everything that Sithis had made and created realms of everlasting imperfection.
<b>&#8313;</b>Thus are the Aedra the false gods, that is, illusion.

<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>So Sithis begat Lorkhan and sent him to destroy the universe.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">Lorkhan! Unstable mutant!</span>

<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>Lorkhan had found the Aedric weakness. While each rebel was, by their nature, immeasurable, they were, through jealously and vanity, also separate from each other.
<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>They were also unwilling to go back to the nothing of before.
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>So while they ruled their false dominions, Lorkhan filled the void with a myriad of new ideas. These ideas were legion.
<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>Soon it seemed that Lorkhan had a dominion of his own, with slaves and everlasting imperfections, and he seemed, for all the world, like an Aedra.
<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>Thus did he present himself as such to the demon Anui-El and the Eight Givers: as a friend.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em">\[
<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>Such was the plan of Lorkhan:

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:5em">To destroy the false gods, free their slaves and reveal their illusion.</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:5em"><b>&sup1;&#8311;</b>And this is how he achieved it:</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:5em">He told them that he was tired of his dominion and wanted to create a new one. This was foolish enough to arouse the curiosity of the always satisfied Aedra.</span>

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:5em"><b>&sup1;&#8312;</b>They watched Lorkhan perform his work. Magnus was the first to express an opinion on this new domain.
<b>&sup1;&#8313;</b>For Lorkhan had duped them all and so Nirn was created.
&emsp;]</span>

<b>&sup2;&#8304;</b>Thus, go unto the Sharmat as a friend.

<span style="display:inline-block;padding-left:4em;font-family:HayghinDaedric;color:red">AE HERMA MORA ALTADOON PADHOME LKHAN AE AI</span>
