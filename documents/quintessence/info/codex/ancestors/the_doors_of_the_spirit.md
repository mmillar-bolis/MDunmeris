<img align="left" alt="T" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_t.svg">he Ancestors are among us. They are never farther away than the Waiting Door.

<b>&sup2;</b>The Ancestors are not departed. The dead are not under the earth.
<b>&sup3;</b>Their spirits are in the restless wind, in the fire's voice, in the foot-smoothed step.
<b>&#8308;</b>Pay heed to these things, and you will know your absent kin.

<b>&#8309;</b>Pay reverence through gift and prayer.
<b>&#8310;</b>Acquaint the Ancestors with your affairs, with your comings and goings, with your blessings and trials.

<b>&#8311;</b>From the Waiting Door comes your protection.
<b>&#8312;</b>Heed the spirits, who are the guardians of your hearth, teachers of wisdom, counselors of fortune, seers of fate.

<b>&#8313;</b>Each bone is a door through the wall of the world.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>Each bone is the road, with Wisdom and Power the travelers.
<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>Each bone is the ghost fence that guards us from evil.

<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>Honor the Ancestors upon your hearths, within your halls, in the community of your temples, in the solitude of your tombs.

<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>Guard your Ancestors from beasts, from thieves, from profane priests and sorcerers.
<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>Let no creature steal your spirits, for the plundered hearth is diminished, and the plundered tomb is shamed.

<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>Live in One World with your spirits. Honor the spirits within and without you.
<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>Do not grieve for the dead. Take shelter in their arms, and pay heed to their words.
