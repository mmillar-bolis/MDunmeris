<b>&sup2;</b>Veloth the Prophet was scorned by those who were blind to the corruption and spiritual bankruptcy at the heart of their society.
<b>&sup3;</b>Veloth was cast out, cast off, by those with no interest in truth and even less interest in the betterment of all, who sought only to preserve their pride and place by keeping others in poverty, ignorance, and slavery.
<b>&#8308;</b>Veloth was highborn, but he dared to cast off the decadent chains of Aldmeri society.

<b>&#8309;</b>Veloth the Mystic called out to those whose souls were weary, whose lives were ground out with no hope of improvement in a society founded on ambition, greed, and decadence.
<b>&#8310;</b>To those who hoped for a society that preserved traditions, praised honesty, and rewarded the just, Veloth's voice was as a golden note among a cacophony.

<b>&#8311;</b>Veloth the Pilgrim led his followers across the seas and away from the lands they had known with the promise of a new land and a better future.
