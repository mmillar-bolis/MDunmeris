#### <span style="color:red">Spirit of Nirn</span>

<img align="left" alt="L" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_l.svg">orkhan is the Spirit
of Nirn, the god of all mortals.
<b>&sup2;</b>This does not mean all mortals necessarily like him or even know him.
<b>&sup3;</b>Most mer hate him, thinking creation as that act which sundered them from the spirit realm.
<b>&#8308;</b>Most humans revere him, or aspects of him, as the herald of existence.

<b>&#8309;</b>The creation of the Mortal Plane, the Mundus, Nirn, is a source of mental anguish to all living things;
<b>&#8310;</b>all souls know deep down they came originally from somewhere else, and that Nirn is a cruel and crucial step to what comes next.
<b>&#8311;</b>What is this next?

Some wish to return to the original state, the spirit realm, and that Lorkhan is the Demon that hinders their way;
<b>&#8312;</b>to them Nirn is a prison, an illusion to escape.

<b>&#8313;</b>Others think that Lorkhan created the world as the testing ground for transcendence;
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>to them the spirit realm was already a prison, that true escape is now finally possible.
