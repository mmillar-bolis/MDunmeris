<img align="left" alt="T" src="../../../project/resources/initials/svg/letters/letter_t.svg">he Daedra are powerful ancestor spirits, similar in form and substance to the Tribunal, but weaker in power, and more arbitrary and removed from the affairs of mortals.
<b>&sup2;</b>In old times, the Chimer worshiped the Daedra as gods. But they did not deserve this veneration, for the Daedra harm their worshipers as often as help them.

<b>&sup3;</b>The Advent of the Tribunal changed this unhappy state.

<b>&#8308;</b>By the Apotheosis, the Tribunal became the Protectors and High Ancestor Spirits of the Dunmer, and bade the Daedra to give proper veneration and obedience.
<b>&#8309;</b>The Three Good Daedra, Boethiah, Azura, and Mephala, recognized the Divinity of the Triune Ancestors.
<b>&#8310;</b>The Rebel Daedra, Molag Bal, Malacath, Sheogorath, and Mehrunes Dagon, refused to swear fealty to the Tribunal, and their worshipers were cast out.

<b>&#8311;</b>These Rebel Daedra thus became the Four Corners of the House of Troubles, and they continue to plague our tranquility and tempt the unwary into Heresy and Dark Worship.
<b>&#8312;</b>The Priests of the Temple remain ever vigilant for signs of the Adversaries' return, sometimes aided by the loyal Three Good Daedra, who are familiar with the wiles of their rebellious kin.

<b>&#8313;</b>The Good Daedra are known to the Temple as the Anticipations, since they are the early ancestral anticipations of the loving patronage of the Tribunal.
<b>&sup1;&#8304;</b>The Anticipations are the Daedra Lords Boethiah, Mephala, and Azura.

<b>&sup1;&sup1;</b>Boethiah is the Anticipation of Almalexia but male to her female.
<b>&sup1;&sup2;</b>Boethiah was the ancestor who illuminated the Aldmer ages ago before the Mythic Era.
<b>&sup1;&sup3;</b>He told them the truth of Lorkhan's test, and defeated Auri-El's champion, Trinimac.
<b>&sup1;&#8308;</b>Boethiah ate Trinimac and voided him.
<b>&sup1;&#8309;</b>The followers of Boethiah and Trinimac rubbed the soil of Trinimac upon themselves and changed their skins.

<b>&sup1;&#8310;</b>Mephala is the Anticipation of Vivec, but manifold and androgynous.
<b>&sup1;&#8311;</b>Mephala taught the Chimer to evade their enemies or kill them with secret murder.
<b>&sup1;&#8312;</b>The Chimer were few in those days and threatened on all sides.
<b>&sup1;&#8313;</b>Mephala taught the Chimer to build Houses.
<b>&sup2;&#8304;</b>Later, Mephala created the Morag Tong.

<b>&sup2;&sup1;</b>Azura is the Anticipation of Sotha Sil, but female to his male.
<b>&sup2;&sup2;</b>Azura was the ancestor who taught the Chimer how to be different from the Altmer. Her teachings are sometimes attributed to Boethiah.
<b>&sup2;&sup3;</b>In the stories, Azura is often encountered more as a communal progenitor of the race as a whole rather than as an individual ancestor.
<b>&sup2;&#8308;</b>She is associated with Dusk and Dawn, and is sometimes called the Mother Soul.
<b>&sup2;&#8309;</b>Azura's Star, also called the Twilight Star, appears briefly at dawn and dusk low on the horizon below the constellation of the Steed.
<b>&sup2;&#8310;</b>Azura is associated with mystery and magic, fate and prophecy.
