## QUINTESSENCE

#### Brief Explanation

I envisioned this text to exist somewhere in the Elder Scrolls universe as a fairly obscure codex composed by someone sympathetic to Outlanders and Temple Expansionism. It's meant to aid Outlander scholars and Imperial speakers who are looking to understand the range of core beliefs held by the followers of As Daenthi, the peculiar religion of Morrowind that most have only heard of as Tribunalism.

The frescoes, the use of Daedric glyphs, and the incorporation of the fan language Casual Dunmeris are all meant to build on the impression of age and development to an outsider perceiving Dunmer culture. And it really is a spectrum and mixed bag, in my opinion. I included texts from TES:III, Tamriel Rebuilt, and TES:O to collect up that wide range of players who have experienced differing but relatable versions of the TES world of the Dunmer.

In editing this into "heirographa", I hoped to pass the first rule of Nerevarine Club, but I also wanted to build further on the Da-Vinci Code-like impression that there were more texts floating around at the top of the Temple that laypeople just don't have direct access to. In leaving a range of subtle to overt breadcrumbs, I hope that it might aid or influence players into exploring more deep and outlandish lore, and maybe reading [C0DA][1] \([what is c0da?][2]\) to join in the discussions.

I wanted to make a tactile object that people could pick up, hold and look at to help get into character and really engage the roleplaying mindset. I also think there are some wonderful religious and moral ideas woven into the Dunmer belief systems. I hope that pulling these texts more closely together will aid a wider audience in identifying the themes and exploring them further outside of the Elder Scrolls series.

So ultimately, my goal with these selections is to encourage readers to push further in research, both in the game and online. I believe that I have ordered them somewhat coherently. The first section tells the creation story and explains the gods, with the farthest backward reaching effects of Tribunal Apotheosis popping up in places among them. It concludes with several texts that establish the continuing role and relationship with the spirits.

The middle three sections largely serve as gospels dedicated to the Three. Almalexia, who chooses the Chimer form and is patron of Dunmer culture, really doesn't have her own ideological text per se. However, there is a growing set of fables that fit well together and I *have* heard others refer to them as the "third book", as it were. So I'm playfully considering it a pseudo-Tradition that has been naturally evolving among players.

The last section serves as doctrinal epistles and prophetic, revelatory texts. I tried to relegate any potentially disputed entries to this one section. It's also where I did the most editing, which some folks won't like, so I'll explain:

The last section opens with excerpts from one of the most controversial sources in the lore, which I don't necessarily consider a part of the *timeline*. However, it tells a *very* eloquent firsthand account of the Apotheosis, which seems theologically significant, to me at least. *The Trial* is an interesting read and all five parts [can be found here][3]. It's also one of the last times we ever got to see the now lost tradition of TES writers publicly RPing in-universe characters to explore or elaborate on ideas. Many of our beloved characters came about through DnD and online RP sessions in the 90s.

I edited the two sections of *Vehk's Teachings* out of their original Q&A format for the sole purpose of more closely resembling the other books. *The Loveletter* was shortened and edited to remove references to the future. I put *The Dragon Break* and *Memories of Sotha Sil* in there to further establish the mysterious role of the Magne-Ge -and to just complicate things for everyone. *The Prophet* though, that one I added for me; it was too funny *not* to include so I had to put my foot down.

C0DA really fills in the details for Kirkbride's vision of the Dunmer Eschaton, which is why I *didn't* include it and went with Sermon 37 instead. As more recent lore threads have been rediscovering, Landfall was initially debated as being either a recurring event at the end of a mythic cycle *or* a final apocalypse. That the term is likely applied to both types of events is what I hope to push others to explore.

Another Temple Stricture I wanted to balance any apocolyptica against was the tenet that lay worship directly benefits the gods. The other side of this then is that directing attention away from them is antithetical to the salvific mission behind Nerevarine Club -which again, can't be spoken of directly.

To put it plainly, in the Lessons, Vivec explains in a roundabout manner that the Tribunal already know of their possible fates through prescience and that the best way to stop Dagoth Ur from swatting down the Nerevarine with that same prescience is to cast as much doubt over the prophecy as possible so that mythically, no one can be sure of the outcome, allowing the Nerevarine to eventually slip back into mortality unseen -even by themselves. (Think Invisible Boy from Mystery Men: "I can only become invisible when noone's watching. If I look at myself, I become visible again.")

I couldn't state this directly anywhere, which meant cutting up *The Trial* for sure. Avoiding the subject of the Nerevarine is also why I didn't include any excerpts from the parallel texts in Vivec's palace. Further, the Nerevarine plays an important role in the Amaranth as well. Again, though, looking too far into the future takes focus off of the gods in the now. Thus, I tried to only include texts or parts of texts that lean heavily on the role of the Tribunal in that matter and left the rest for players to find for themselves.

I totally admit that the selection of the Telvanni symbol for the World-Egg is a bit far-fetched but it *does* seem like more than *just* a mushroom tower to me. Just like the Judge's Scale of House Hlaalu or the Scarab of House Redoran, I decided that there is likely a motif in writing somewhere that matches the symbol for Telvanni and felt that the World Egg most closely described the depiction. The text I placed next to it comes from the 1999 post [Cosmology][4], which I also edited out of it's Q&A format.

The opening of the book has three introductions. One was written by me, but the other two are [The Living Gods][5] and [Worshiping the Illogical][6].

#### Credits and Thanks

The ALMSIVI fresco seen in the Temple Oath was originally made by [Tyddyner][7] \([1][8], [2][9], [3][10]\). The Anticipation frescoes for each god were originally made by [TheMyzel][11] \([1][12], [2][13], [3][14]\). The maps are originally made by [Nathan Wilkes][15]. The Temple of Vivec and Anu/Padomay frescoes are mockups from the artbook. The Great House frescoes are from the internet but I *could not* find the authors, so if you spot them, please let me know! The Ghartok Trigon frescoes are also totally custom.

Thanks to Michael Kirkbride, Douglass Goodall, and all the Bethesda teams involved. Thanks also to the authors and contributors of Tamriel Rebuilt for the texts *The Worship of the Ashlanders* and [*Ruhn Ania ALMSIVI*][16].

Thanks for looking!
