## QUINTESSENCE

#### Brief Explanation

This was just a fun personal project. The source is available for everyone to modify.

I envisioned this text to exist somewhere in the Elder Scrolls universe as an obscure codex composed by someone sympathetic to Outlanders and Temple Expansionism. It's meant to aid western scholars and Imperial speakers who are looking to understand the range of core beliefs held by the followers of the Temple (*as Daenthi*), the peculiar and insular religion of Morrowind.

The frescoes, the use of Daedric glyphs, and the incorporation of the fan language [Casual Dunmeris][1] are all meant to build on the impression of age and development to an outsider perceiving Dunmer culture. And it really is a spectrum and mixed bag, in my needless opinion. I included texts from TES:III, Tamriel Rebuilt, and TES:O to collect up that wide range of players who have experienced differing but relatable versions of the worldview of the Dunmer.

In editing this into *heirographa*, I hoped to pass the First Rule of Nerevarine Club, and play off of the Da-Vinci Code-like impression that there were more texts floating around at the top of the Temple that laypeople may not have direct access to. In leaving a range of subtle to overt breadcrumbs, I hope that it might aid or influence players into exploring more deep and outlandish lore, and maybe reading [C0DA][2] \([what is c0da?][3]\) to join in the discussions.

I also wanted to make a tactile object that people could pick up, hold and look at to help get into character and really engage in the roleplaying mindset. Aside from that, I think there are some wonderful religious and moral ideas woven into the Dunmer belief systems. I hope that pulling these texts more closely together will aid a wider audience in identifying their themes and exploring them further outside of the Elder Scrolls series.

So ultimately, my goal with these selections is to encourage readers to push further in research, both in the game and online. I believe that I have ordered the texts somewhat coherently. The first section tells the creation story and explains the conventional gods, along with the farthest backward reaching effects of Tribunal Apotheosis popping up in places among them. It heads down the subgradient deities until it concludes with several texts that establish the continuing role and relationship of the spirits with the living.

The middle three sections largely serve as gospels dedicated to the three incarnate gods. The 36 Lessons was the inspiration for this project at all, however the 12 Sermons of the *Truth in Sequence* seem to be historically misunderstood. Though, when taken at the value of their ideas, the core themes all align perfectly with *The Lessons* and provides yet another protoevangelium.

Almalexia, who chooses the Chimer form and is referred to as patron of Dunmer culture, doesn't really have her own ideological text, per se. However, there is a growing set of fables that fit well together and I *have* heard others refer to them as the "third book", as it were. Have a look at the canon of the [Servants of the Tribunal][4] if you're interested in where I initially found the inspiration to combine them.

The last section serves as doctrinal epistles and prophetic, revelatory texts. I tried to relegate any potentially *disputed* books to this one section. It's also where I did the most editing, which some folks won't like, so I'll explain myself beforehand:

The opening of the last section contains excerpts from one of the more generally controversial sources in the extended lore &mdash;which I don't necessarily consider a part of the "greater timeline", however, it tells a *very* eloquent account of the Apotheosis, which seems theologically significant to me at least. *The Trial* is beyond an interesting read, and all five parts [can be found here][5].

Next, I edited two sections of *Vehk's Teachings* out of their original Q&A format. Admittedly, this was to more closely resemble the other books around them. *The Loveletter* was shortened and edited to remove some more specific references to the future. I put *The Dragon Break* and *Memories of Sotha Sil* in there to further establish the mysterious role of the Magne-Ge in the universe &mdash;and to just further complicate things for everyone. Though, *The Prophet of Landfall*, that one I added just for me; it was simply too funny *not* to include so I had to put my foot down. :P

C0DA really fills in the details for Kirkbride's vision of the Dunmer Eschaton, I think, which is partly why I *didn't* include it and went with Sermon 37 instead. I didn't want to be too concrete on anything, but another Temple Stricture that I wanted to balance any apocolyptica against was the absolute tenet that lay worship *must* directly benefit the gods. This is a key aspect in the struggle against Dagoth Ur and the other side of this, then, is that directing attention away from the gods is antithetical to the salvific mission behind Nerevarine Club -which again, can't be spoken of directly.

Here's my take on the dilemma of Morrowind's hero saga:

>!From what I gathered in the 36 Lessons \(especially [11][6], [13][7], and [15][8]\), Vivec explains in a roundabout manner that the Tribunal *already know* of their probable mortal fates through prescience, and that the best way to stop Dagoth Ur from swatting down the Nerevarine with that same prescience is to cast as much doubt over the the threads of fate as possible so that mythically, no one can be sure of the outcome, allowing the Nerevarine to eventually slip back into mortality, unseen &mdash;perhaps even by themselves (or more succinctly, it just takes time and pressure to stimulate the world-organ into eventually reproducing Nerevar).!<

Just utter profanity. Look away, my dear children.

>!I see it as a play on the aspect of quantum states. To grossly oversimplify, in quantum theory, once an object's position can be identified, it's trajectory can no longer be predicted. Vice-versa, if an object's trajectory can be predicted, it's position cannot be verified. Vivec's gamble as expressed in *The Lessons* (and *Sithis*) is that if the Hortator approaches the Sharmat with openness, their movements will remain largely unseen by him and his mythical schemes. (Think Invisible Boy from Mystery Men: "I can only become invisible when no-one's watching. If I look at myself, I become visible again.") This motif works in a myriad of ways between their interactions.!<

I couldn't state anything even remotely like this directly, however, which meant cutting up *The Trial* for sure. Avoiding the subject of Nerevar is also why I didn't include any excerpts from the parallel texts in Vivec's palace. Finally the Nerevarine plays an important role in the Amaranth as well. Again though, looking too far into the future takes focus off of the gods in the now. Thus, I tried to only include texts &mdash;or parts of texts&mdash; that lean heavily on the role of the Tribunal and left the rest of the information for players to find for themselves.

Now, I totally admit that the selection of the Telvanni symbol for the World-Egg is a bit far-fetched but it *does* seem like more than *just* a mushroom tower to me. Just like the Judge's Scale of House Hlaalu or the Scarab of House Redoran, I decided that there is likely a motif in writing somewhere that matches the symbol for Telvanni and felt that the World Egg most closely described the depiction. Later, I came across an artist's [rendition of the symbol][9] in the form of a [mandala][10], which bolstered my belief that I'm not the only one to read more into the depiction. The text I placed next to the Telvanni symbol comes from the 1999 post [Cosmology][11], which I also edited out of it's Q&A format.

The opening of the book has three introductions. One was written by me, but the other two are [The Living Gods][12] and [Worshiping the Illogical][13].
